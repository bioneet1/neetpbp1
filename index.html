Early classification was done instinctively not using scientific criteria but for using organisms for food shelter and clothing.<br><br>3. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more scientific basis for classification.<br><br>4. Aristotle used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees shrubs and herbs.<br><br>5. Aristotle divided animals into two groups those which had red blood and those that did not.<br><br>6. In Linnaeus time a Two Kingdom system of classification with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed.<br><br>7. Two Kingdom system included all plants and animals respectively.<br><br>8. Two Kingdom system did not distinguish between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.<br><br>9. Two Kingdom system did not distinguish between unicellular and multicellular organisms.<br><br>10. Two Kingdom system did not distinguish between photosynthetic green algae and non-photosynthetic fungi organisms.<br><br>11. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily done and easy to understand.<br><br>12. A large number of organisms did not fall into either plant or animal category in two kingdom classification.<br><br>13. The two kingdom classification used for a long time was found inadequate.<br><br>14. Besides gross morphology a need was felt for including characteristics like cell structure nature of wall mode of nutrition habitat methods of reproduction and evolutionary relationships.<br><br>15. Classification systems for living organisms have undergone several changes over time.<br><br>16. Plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all different classification systems.<br><br>17. The understanding of what groups or organisms be included under plant and animal kingdoms have been changing over time.<br><br>18. The number and nature of other kingdoms have been understood differently by different scientists over time."],

Chlamydomonas and Chlorella have cell walls while Paramecium and Amoeba lack cell walls.<br><br>8. Earlier classifications placed organisms in different kingdoms but criteria for classification changed over time.<br><br>9. Changes in classification will take place in future depending on improvement in understanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships.<br><br>10. Modern classification attempts to reflect not only morphological physiological and reproductive similarities but also phylogenetic similarities.<br><br>11. Phylogenetic similarities refer to evolutionary relationships among organisms.<br><br>12. Kingdoms Monera Protista and Fungi are studied in this chapter from Whittaker system of classification.<br><br>13. Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4.<br><br>14. Bacteria are the sole members of Kingdom Monera.<br><br>15. Bacteria are the most abundant micro-organisms.<br><br>16. Bacteria occur almost everywhere in various environments.<br><br>17. Hundreds of bacteria are present in a handful of soil.<br><br>18. Bacteria live in extreme habitats such as hot springs deserts snow and deep oceans.<br><br>19. Very few other life forms can survive in extreme habitats where bacteria live.<br><br>20. Many bacteria live in or on other organisms as parasites.<br><br>21. Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape.<br><br>22. The four bacterial shapes are spherical Coccus rod-shaped Bacillus comma-shaped Vibrio and spiral Spirillum.<br><br>23. The plural form of Coccus is cocci.<br><br>24. The plural form of Bacillus is bacilli.<br><br>25. The plural form of Vibrio is vibrio.<br><br>26. The plural form of Spirillum is spirilla.<br><br>27.

Bacteria as a group show the most extensive metabolic diversity compared to many other organisms.<br><br>3. Some bacteria are autotrophic and synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates.<br><br>4. Autotrophic bacteria may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic.<br><br>5. The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs depending on other organisms or dead organic matter for food.<br><br>6. Archaebacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats.<br><br>7. Halophiles are archaebacteria living in extreme salty areas.<br><br>8. Thermoacidophiles are archaebacteria living in hot springs.<br><br>9. Methanogens are archaebacteria living in marshy areas.<br><br>10. Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria in having a different cell wall structure.<br><br>11. Different cell wall structure is responsible for archaebacteria survival in extreme conditions.<br><br>12. Methanogens are present in the gut of several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes.<br><br>13. Methanogens are responsible for production of methane biogas from the dung of ruminant animals.<br><br>14. There are thousands of different eubacteria or true bacteria.<br><br>15. Eubacteria are characterised by presence of a rigid cell wall and if motile a flagellum.<br><br>16. Cyanobacteria are also referred to as blue-green algae.<br><br>17. Cyanobacteria have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are photosynthetic autotrophs.<br><br>18. Cyanobacteria are unicellular colonial or filamentous.<br><br>19. Cyanobacteria can be freshwater marine or terrestrial algae.<br><br>20. Colonies of cyanobacteria are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath.<br><br>21. Cyanobacteria often form blooms in polluted water bodies.<br><br>22. Some cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen in specialised cells called heterocysts.<br><br>23. Nostoc and Anabaena are examples of cyanobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen in heterocysts.<br><br>24. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria oxidise various inorganic substances such as nitrates nitrites and ammonia.<br><br>25. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria use the released energy for their ATP production.<br><br>26. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria play a great role in recycling nutrients like nitrogen phosphorous iron and sulphur.<br><br>27. Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in nature.<br><br>28. The majority of heterotrophic bacteria are important decomposers.<br><br>29. Many heterotrophic bacteria have a significant impact on human affairs.<br><br>30.

Sexual reproduction in fungi is by oospores ascospores and basidiospores.<br><br>3. The various spores in fungi are produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies.<br><br>4. The sexual cycle in fungi involves three steps plasmogamy karyogamy and meiosis.<br><br>5. Plasmogamy is fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes.<br><br>6. Karyogamy is fusion of two nuclei.<br><br>7. Meiosis in zygote results in haploid spores.<br><br>8. When a fungus reproduces sexually two haploid hyphae of compatible mating types come together and fuse.<br><br>9. In some fungi fusion of two haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells 2n.<br><br>10. In ascomycetes and basidiomycetes an intervening dikaryotic stage n plus n i.e. two nuclei per cell occurs.<br><br>11. The condition where fungal cell has two haploid nuclei is called a dikaryon.<br><br>12. The phase where fungal cells have two haploid nuclei is called dikaryophase of fungus.<br><br>13. Later the parental nuclei fuse and the cells become diploid in dikaryophase.<br><br>14. The fungi form fruiting bodies in which reduction division occurs leading to formation of haploid spores.<br><br>15. The morphology of mycelium mode of spore formation and fruiting bodies form the basis for division of kingdom Fungi into various classes.<br><br>16. Members of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats and on decaying wood in moist and damp places as obligate parasites on plants.<br><br>17. The mycelium in phycomycetes is aseptate and coenocytic.<br><br>18. Asexual reproduction in phycomycetes takes place by zoospores motile or by aplanospores non-motile.<br><br>19. Spores in phycomycetes are endogenously produced in sporangium.<br><br>20. A zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes in phycomycetes.<br><br>21. Gametes in phycomycetes are similar in morphology isogamous or dissimilar anisogamous or oogamous.<br><br>22. Examples of phycomycetes are Mucor Rhizopus the bread mould and Albugo the parasitic fungi on mustard.<br><br>23. Ascomycetes are commonly known as sac-fungi.<br><br>24. The ascomycetes are mostly multicellular like Penicillium or rarely unicellular like yeast Saccharomyces.<br><br>25.

The Rh antigen is observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80 per cent) of humans.<br><br>3. Individuals having Rh antigen are called Rh positive (Rh+ve).<br><br>4. Individuals in whom Rh antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve).<br><br>5. An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies against the Rh antigens.<br><br>6. Rh group should also be matched before blood transfusions to avoid incompatibility.<br><br>7. A special case of Rh incompatibility has been observed between Rh-ve blood of pregnant mother with Rh+ve blood of foetus.<br><br>8. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of mother in first pregnancy as the two bloods are well separated by placenta.<br><br>9. During delivery of the first child, there is a possibility of exposure of maternal blood to small amounts of Rh+ve blood from foetus.<br><br>10. In such cases, the mother starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood.<br><br>11. In case of subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from mother (Rh-ve) can leak into blood of foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy foetal RBCs.<br><br>12. This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and jaundice to the baby.<br><br>13. The condition of destruction of foetal RBCs is called erythroblastosis foetalis.<br><br>14. Erythroblastosis foetalis can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother immediately after delivery of the first child.<br><br>15. When you cut your finger or hurt yourself, the wound does not continue to bleed for a long time as blood stops flowing after sometime.<br><br>16. Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma.<br><br>17. Coagulation is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body.<br><br>18. A dark reddish brown scum is formed at the site of a cut or injury over a period of time.<br><br>19. It is a clot or coagulum formed mainly of a network of threads called fibrins.<br><br>20. Dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped in the fibrin network.<br><br>21. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin.<br><br>22. Thrombins are formed from another inactive substance present in plasma called prothrombin.<br><br>23. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.<br><br>24. Thrombokinase complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process).<br><br>25. The cascade process involves a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state.<br><br>26.

Annelids and chordates have a closed circulatory system.<br><br>16. In closed circulatory system, blood pumped by heart is always circulated through a closed network of blood vessels.<br><br>17. Closed circulatory system is considered more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be more precisely regulated.<br><br>18. All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart.<br><br>19. Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle.<br><br>20. Amphibians and reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle.<br><br>21. Crocodiles, birds, and mammals possess a 4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles.<br><br>22. In fishes, the heart pumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills.<br><br>23. Oxygenated blood from gills is supplied to body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to heart in fishes (single circulation).<br><br>24. In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from gills/lungs/skin.<br><br>25. In amphibians and reptiles, the right atrium gets deoxygenated blood from other body parts.<br><br>26. In amphibians and reptiles, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood get mixed up in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double circulation).<br><br>27. In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood received by left and right atria respectively passes on to ventricles of the same sides.<br><br>28. In birds and mammals, the ventricles pump out blood without any mixing.<br><br>29. Two separate circulatory pathways are present in birds and mammals, hence these animals have double circulation."],

Heart valves prevent any backward flow of blood.<br><br>4. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles.<br><br>5. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria.<br><br>6.

A patch of nodal tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino-atrial node (SAN).<br><br>8. Another mass of nodal tissue is seen in the lower left corner of right atrium close to atrio-ventricular septum called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN).<br><br>9. A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio-ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN.<br><br>10. The AV bundle passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of inter-ventricular septum.<br><br>11. The AV bundle immediately divides into a right and left bundle on the inter-ventricular septum.<br><br>12. These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular musculature of respective sides called purkinje fibres.<br><br>13. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable.<br><br>14. The number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system.<br><br>15. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 70-75 min-1.<br><br>16.

The P-wave represents the electrical excitation (or depolarisation) of the atria, which leads to contraction of both atria.<br><br>5. The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of the ventricles, which initiates the ventricular contraction.<br><br>6. The contraction starts shortly after Q and marks the beginning of the systole.<br><br>7. The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal state (repolarisation).<br><br>8. The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole.<br><br>9. By counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a given time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual.<br><br>10. ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same shape for a given lead configuration.<br><br>11. Any deviation from normal ECG shape indicates a possible abnormality or disease.<br><br>12. ECG is of great clinical significance.<br><br>13. The blood flows strictly by a fixed route through blood vessels - the arteries and veins.<br><br>14. Each artery and vein consists of three layers.<br><br>15. The innermost layer is an inner lining of squamous endothelium called the tunica intima.<br><br>16. The middle layer is composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibres called the tunica media.<br><br>17. The outermost layer is an external layer of fibrous connective tissue with collagen fibres called the tunica externa.<br><br>18. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins.<br><br>19. Blood pumped by the right ventricle enters the pulmonary artery.<br><br>20. The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta.<br><br>21. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is passed on to the lungs.<br><br>22. From the lungs, oxygenated blood is carried by the pulmonary veins into the left atrium.<br><br>23. This pathway from right ventricle to left atrium via lungs constitutes the pulmonary circulation.<br><br>24. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is carried by a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries to the tissues.<br><br>25. From tissues, deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules, veins, and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium.<br><br>26. This pathway from left ventricle to right atrium via body tissues is the systemic circulation.<br><br>27. The systemic circulation provides nutrients, O2, and other essential substances to the tissues.<br><br>28. The systemic circulation takes CO2 and other harmful substances away for elimination.<br><br>29. A unique vascular connection exists between the digestive tract and liver called hepatic portal system."],

There are millions of plants and animals in the world known by their local names in different areas.<br><br>3. Local names of organisms vary from place to place, even within a country.<br><br>4. There is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms so that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world.<br><br>5. The process of standardising names of living organisms is called nomenclature.<br><br>6. Nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to, which is called identification.<br><br>7. Scientists have evolved procedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism that is acceptable to biologists all over the world.<br><br>8. Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature or ICZN.<br><br>9. The scientific names ensure that each organism has only one name worldwide.<br><br>10. Description of any organism should enable people in any part of the world to arrive at the same name.<br><br>11. Scientific naming ensures that a name has not been used for any other known organism.<br><br>12.

Name of the author appears after the specific epithet at the end of the biological name and is written in abbreviated form, e.g., Mangifera indica Linn.<br><br>3. Mangifera indica Linn. indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.<br><br>4. Since it is nearly impossible to study all living organisms, it is necessary to devise some means to make this possible, which is classification.<br><br>5. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped into convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.<br><br>6. We easily recognise groups such as plants, animals, dogs, cats or insects based on associated characters.<br><br>7. Dogs, Cats, Mammals, Wheat, Rice, Plants, Animals etc. are convenient categories we use to study organisms.<br><br>8. The categories used to study organisms are called taxa.<br><br>9. Taxa can indicate categories at very different levels - Plants form a taxa, Wheat is also a taxa, and similarly Animals, Mammals and Dogs are all taxa.<br><br>10. A dog is a mammal and mammals are animals, therefore animals, mammals and dogs represent taxa at different levels.<br><br>11. Based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified into different taxa.<br><br>12. The process of classification into different taxa is called taxonomy.<br><br>13.

Taxonomy is not something new - human beings have always been interested in knowing more about various kinds of organisms.<br><br>16. In early days, human beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter.<br><br>17. The earliest classifications were based on the uses of various organisms.<br><br>18.

The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature and classification.<br><br>3. Systematics takes into account evolutionary relationships between organisms.<br><br>4. Classification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps in which each step represents a rank or category.<br><br>5. A category is a part of overall taxonomic arrangement and is called the taxonomic category.<br><br>6. All categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy.<br><br>7. Each category is referred to as a unit of classification and represents a rank, commonly termed as taxon (plural: taxa).<br><br>8. Taxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by examples like insects which share common features like three pairs of jointed legs.<br><br>9. Insects are recognisable concrete objects which can be classified and thus were given a rank or category.<br><br>10. Groups represent category and category further denotes rank.<br><br>11. Each rank or taxon represents a unit of classification.<br><br>12. Taxonomic groups or categories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological aggregates.<br><br>13. Taxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the development of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division (for plants), class, order, family, genus and species.<br><br>14. All organisms including those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the lowest category.<br><br>15. The basic requirement to refer to an organism in various categories is the knowledge of characters of an individual or group of organisms.<br><br>16. Knowledge of characters helps in identifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the same kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms.<br><br>17. Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities as a species.<br><br>18. One should be able to distinguish one species from other closely related species based on distinct morphological differences.<br><br>19. In Mangifera indica, Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion), indica, tuberosum and leo represent the specific epithets.<br><br>20. In Mangifera indica, Solanum tuberosum and Panthera leo, the first words Mangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represent another higher level of taxon or category.<br><br>21. Each genus may have one or more than one specific epithets representing different organisms but having morphological similarities.<br><br>22. Panthera has another specific epithet called tigris (Panthera tigris - tiger).<br><br>23. Solanum includes species like nigrum and tuberosum showing that one genus can have multiple species."],

Kingdom Plantae is popularly known as the plant kingdom and is dealt with in detail in this chapter.<br><br>3. The understanding of the plant kingdom has changed over time with organisms being reclassified based on new scientific evidence.<br><br>4. Fungi and members of Monera and Protista having cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier classification placed them in the same kingdom.<br><br>5. Cyanobacteria that are also referred to as blue green algae are not algae anymore and have been excluded from Kingdom Plantae.<br><br>6. The modern classification of Kingdom Plantae includes Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms.<br><br>7. The earliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphological characters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves.<br><br>8. Early classification systems were based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium structure.<br><br>9. The artificial classification system was given by Linnaeus and was based on the androecium structure.<br><br>10. Artificial classification systems were artificial because they separated closely related species since they were based on a few characteristics.<br><br>11. Artificial systems gave equal weightage to vegetative and sexual characteristics which is not acceptable.<br><br>12. Vegetative characters are more easily affected by environment and therefore are not reliable for classification.<br><br>13. Natural classification systems developed as an improvement over artificial systems and were based on natural affinities among organisms.<br><br>14.

Algae increase the level of dissolved oxygen in their immediate environment through photosynthesis.<br><br>3. Algae are of paramount importance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form the basis of food cycles of all aquatic animals.<br><br>4. Many species of Porphyra, Laminaria and Sargassum are among the 70 species of marine algae used as food.<br><br>5. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts of hydrocolloids which are water holding substances.<br><br>6. Algin is a hydrocolloid obtained from brown algae and carrageen is obtained from red algae which are used commercially.<br><br>7. Agar is one of the commercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria used to grow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies.<br><br>8. Chlorella is a unicellular alga rich in proteins and is used as food supplement even by space travellers.<br><br>9. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.<br><br>10. Members of Chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae and the plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous.<br><br>11. Green algae are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b.<br><br>12. In green algae, the pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts which may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species.<br><br>13. Most members of green algae have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts.<br><br>14. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch and some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.<br><br>15. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose.<br><br>16. Vegetative reproduction in green algae usually takes place by fragmentation.<br><br>17. Asexual reproduction in green algae is by flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia.<br><br>18. Sexual reproduction in green algae shows considerable variation and may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.<br><br>19. Some commonly found green algae are Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara.<br><br>20. Members of Phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in marine habitats.<br><br>21. Brown algae show great variation in size and form ranging from simple branched filamentous forms like Ectocarpus to profusely branched forms like kelps.<br><br>22. Kelps may reach a height of 100 metres and represent profusely branched brown algae.<br><br>23. Brown algae possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls as pigments.<br><br>24.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Bryophytes are called amphibians of the plant kingdom because they can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction.<br><br>2. Bryophytes usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities and play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks and soil.<br><br>3. The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae and may be thallus-like and prostrate or erect.<br><br>4. Bryophytes are attached to the substratum by unicellular or multicellular rhizoids and lack true roots, stem or leaves.<br><br>5. The main plant body of bryophytes is haploid and produces gametes, hence is called a gametophyte.<br><br>6. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular with the male sex organ called antheridium and female sex organ called archegonium.<br><br>7. Antheridium produces biflagellate antherozoids while archegonium is flask-shaped and produces a single egg.<br><br>8. The antherozoids are released into water where they come in contact with archegonium and an antherozoid fuses with the egg to produce the zygote.<br><br>9. Zygotes in bryophytes do not undergo reduction division immediately but produce a multicellular body called sporophyte.<br><br>10. The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte and derives nourishment from it.<br><br>11. Some cells of the sporophyte undergo reduction division or meiosis to produce haploid spores.<br><br>12. The spores germinate to produce gametophyte completing the life cycle.<br><br>13. Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals.<br><br>14. Sphagnum moss provides peat that has long been used as fuel and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material due to its capacity to hold water.<br><br>15. Mosses along with lichens are the first organisms to colonise rocks and are of great ecological importance.<br><br>16. Mosses decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of higher plants.<br><br>17. Mosses form dense mats on the soil and reduce the impact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion.<br><br>18. Bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.<br><br>19. Liverworts grow usually in moist shady habitats such as banks of streams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and in woods.<br><br>20. The plant body of a liverwort is thalloid as seen in Marchantia.<br><br>21. The thallus of liverworts is dorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate.<br><br>22. The leafy members of liverworts have tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.<br><br>23. Asexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of thalli or by formation of specialised structures called gemmae.<br><br>24. Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds which develop in small receptacles called gemma cups located on the thalli.<br><br>25. The gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to form new individuals.<br><br>26. During sexual reproduction in liverworts, male and female sex organs are produced."],

The sporophyte in liverworts is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule.<br><br>3. After meiosis in liverworts, spores are produced within the capsule which germinate to form free-living gametophytes.<br><br>4. The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages.<br><br>5. The first stage in moss gametophyte is the protonema stage which develops directly from a spore.<br><br>6. The protonema stage is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage.<br><br>7. The second stage in moss is the leafy stage which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud.<br><br>8. The leafy stage consists of upright slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves attached to soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids.<br><br>9. The sex organs in mosses are borne on the leafy stage.<br><br>10. Vegetative reproduction in mosses occurs by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema.<br><br>11. In sexual reproduction in mosses, the sex organs antheridium and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.<br><br>12. After fertilisation in mosses, the zygote develops into a sporophyte consisting of foot, seta and capsule.<br><br>13. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts.<br><br>14.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The free-living gametophytes in pteridophytes are called prothallus which are mostly photosynthetic and thalloid.<br><br>2. Prothallus requires cool, damp and shady places to grow.<br><br>3. The spread of living pteridophytes is limited and restricted to narrow geographical regions due to requirement of water for fertilisation.<br><br>4. The gametophytes in pteridophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia respectively.<br><br>5. Water is required for transfer of antherozoids (male gametes) from antheridia to the mouth of archegonium.<br><br>6. Fusion of male gamete with the egg present in the archegonium results in the formation of zygote.<br><br>7. The zygote produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte which is the dominant phase of pteridophytes.<br><br>8. In majority of pteridophytes all spores are of similar kinds and such plants are called homosporous.<br><br>9. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia produce two kinds of spores macro or large and micro or small spores and are known as heterosporous.<br><br>10. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give rise to female and male gametophytes respectively.<br><br>11. In heterosporous pteridophytes the female gametophytes are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods.<br><br>12. The development of zygotes into young embryos takes place within the female gametophytes in heterosporous pteridophytes.<br><br>13. The development of embryo within female gametophyte is a precursor to the seed habit considered an important step in evolution.<br><br>14. Pteridophytes are classified into four classes: Psilopsida, Lycopsida, Sphenopsida and Pteropsida.<br><br>15. Psilopsida includes Psilotum while Lycopsida includes Selaginella and Lycopodium.<br><br>16. Sphenopsida includes Equisetum while Pteropsida includes Dryopteris, Pteris and Adiantum.<br><br>17. Gymnosperms means naked seeds as the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed both before and after fertilisation.<br><br>18. The seeds in gymnosperms develop post-fertilisation and are not covered hence are naked.<br><br>19. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees, tall trees and shrubs.<br><br>20. Sequoia is a giant redwood tree and is one of the tallest tree species among gymnosperms.<br><br>21. The roots in gymnosperms are generally tap roots.<br><br>22. Roots in some genera like Pinus have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza.<br><br>23. In Cycas small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.<br><br>24. The stems in gymnosperms are unbranched as in Cycas or branched as in Pinus and Cedrus.<br><br>25. The leaves in gymnosperms may be simple or compound.<br><br>26. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few years.<br><br>27. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity and wind.<br><br>28.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Gymnosperms are heterosporous plants that produce two distinct types of spores - haploid microspores and megaspores.<br><br>2. The two kinds of spores are produced within different sporangia that are borne on sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axis to form lax or compact strobili or cones.<br><br>3. The strobili bearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are called microsporangiate or male strobili.<br><br>4. Microspores develop into a male gametophyte generation which is highly reduced and is confined to only a limited number of cells.<br><br>5. The reduced male gametophyte in gymnosperms is called a pollen grain.<br><br>6. The development of pollen grains takes place within the microsporangia.<br><br>7. The cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or megasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female strobili.<br><br>8. The male or female cones or strobili may be borne on the same tree such as in Pinus or on different trees as in Cycas making them dioecious.<br><br>9. In Cycas, male cones and megasporophylls are borne on different trees showing dioecious condition.<br><br>10. The megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of the cells of the nucellus in the ovule.<br><br>11. The nucellus is protected by envelopes and the composite structure is called an ovule.<br><br>12. The ovules are borne on megasporophylls which may be clustered to form the female cones.<br><br>13. The megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four megaspores.<br><br>14. One of the megaspores enclosed within the megasporangium develops into a multicellular female gametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or female sex organs.<br><br>15. The multicellular female gametophyte is also retained within megasporangium unlike in bryophytes and pteridophytes.<br><br>16. In gymnosperms, the male and the female gametophytes do not have an independent free-living existence.<br><br>17. The gametophytes in gymnosperms remain within the sporangia retained on the sporophytes.<br><br>18. The pollen grain is released from the microsporangium and is carried by air currents in gymnosperms.<br><br>19. Pollen grains come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne on megasporophylls during pollination.<br><br>20. The pollen tube carrying the male gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules and discharge their contents near the mouth of the archegonia.<br><br>21. Following fertilization, zygote develops into an embryo and the ovules into seeds which are not covered.<br><br>22. These seeds in gymnosperms are not covered showing the characteristic naked seed condition."],

Unlike gymnosperms where ovules are naked, in angiosperms or flowering plants the pollen grains and ovules are developed in specialized structures called flowers.<br><br>2. In angiosperms, the seeds are enclosed in fruits after fertilization.<br><br>3. Angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of plants occurring in wide range of habitats.<br><br>4. Angiosperms range in size from smallest Wolffia to tall trees of Eucalyptus over 100 metres.<br><br>5. Angiosperms provide us with food, fodder, fuel, medicines and several other commercially important products.<br><br>6. Angiosperms are divided into two classes - the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons.<br><br>7. Dicotyledonous plants have two cotyledons in their seeds.<br><br>8. Monocotyledonous plants have one cotyledon in their seeds.<br><br>9. The plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.<br><br>10. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple thalloid autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms.<br><br>11. Algae are classified into three classes namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae depending on the type of pigments present and form of stored food.<br><br>12. Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by formation of different types of spores and sexually by fusion of gametes which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.<br><br>13. Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction.<br><br>14. The plant body in bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.<br><br>15. Bryophytes have a thallus-like body which is prostrate or erect and attached to the substratum by rhizoids.<br><br>16. Bryophytes possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-like structures.<br><br>17. The bryophyte plant body is haploid and produces gametes hence is called a gametophyte.<br><br>18. The dominant phase in the bryophyte life cycle is the gametophyte.<br><br>19.

The main plant body of a bryophyte is haploid and it produces gametes hence is called gametophyte.<br><br>5. Bryophytes bear the male sex organs called antheridia and female sex organs called archegonia.<br><br>6. The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte.<br><br>7. The sporophyte in bryophytes produces haploid spores through meiotic division.<br><br>8. The spores in bryophytes germinate to form gametophytes completing the life cycle.<br><br>9. In pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves.<br><br>10.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Class Chondrichthyes includes marine animals with a cartilaginous endoskeleton instead of bones.<br><br>2. The body of cartilaginous fishes is streamlined which helps them move efficiently through water.<br><br>3. In Chondrichthyes, the mouth is mostly located at the terminal position.<br><br>4. Chondrichthyes have four pairs of gills which are covered by separate gill slits without an operculum.<br><br>5. The skin of cartilaginous fishes is tough and contains minute placoid scales.<br><br>6. Placoid scales in Chondrichthyes are backwardly directed providing protection.<br><br>7. The teeth of Chondrichthyes are modified placoid scales which are very powerful.<br><br>8. Air bladder is absent in Chondrichthyes so they have to swim constantly to avoid sinking.<br><br>9. Some members of Chondrichthyes possess electric organs for defense and predation like Torpedo.<br><br>10. Some cartilaginous fishes have a poison sting for protection like Trygon (Sting ray).<br><br>11. The heart of Chondrichthyes is two-chambered consisting of one auricle and one ventricle.<br><br>12. Chondrichthyes are cold-blooded animals meaning they cannot regulate their body temperature.<br><br>13. Sexes are separate in cartilaginous fishes with males having claspers on pelvic fins.<br><br>14. Fertilisation in Chondrichthyes is internal and many of them are viviparous.<br><br>15. Examples of Chondrichthyes include Scoliodon (Dog fish), Pristis (Saw fish), Carcharodon (Great white shark), and Trygon (Sting ray).<br><br>16. Class Osteichthyes includes both marine and freshwater fishes with a bony endoskeleton.<br><br>17. Bony fishes have a streamlined body shape and the mouth is mostly terminal.<br><br>18. Osteichthyes have four pairs of gills which are covered by an operculum on each side.<br><br>19. The skin of bony fishes is covered with cycloid or ctenoid scales.<br><br>20. Air bladder is present in Osteichthyes which helps in regulating buoyancy.<br><br>21. The heart of Osteichthyes is two-chambered with one auricle and one ventricle.<br><br>22. Bony fishes are cold-blooded animals that cannot regulate their internal body temperature.<br><br>23. Sexes are separate in Osteichthyes and fertilisation is usually external.<br><br>24. Most bony fishes are oviparous meaning they lay eggs and development is direct.<br><br>25. Examples of Osteichthyes include Exocoetus (Flying fish), Hippocampus (Sea horse), Labeo (Rohu), Catla, and Betta (Fighting fish).<br><br>26. Class Amphibia derives its name from their ability to live dual lives in aquatic and terrestrial habitats.<br><br>27. Most amphibians have two pairs of limbs adapted for locomotion on land and in water.<br><br>28. The body of amphibians is divisible into head and trunk with tail present in some species.<br><br>29. Amphibian skin is moist and lacks scales which helps in cutaneous respiration.<br><br>30. Eyes of amphibians have eyelids for protection.<br><br>31. The tympanum represents the ear structure in amphibians for detecting sound.<br><br>32. In amphibians, the alimentary canal, urinary tract and reproductive tract all open into a common chamber called cloaca.<br><br>33. The cloaca in amphibians opens to the exterior through a single opening.<br><br>34. Respiration in amphibians occurs through gills in larval stage, lungs in adults, and also through moist skin.<br><br>35. The heart of amphibians is three-chambered consisting of two auricles and one ventricle.<br><br>36. Amphibians are cold-blooded animals unable to maintain constant body temperature.<br><br>37. Sexes are separate in amphibians and fertilisation is external.<br><br>38. Amphibians are oviparous animals that lay eggs in water.<br><br>39. Development in amphibians is indirect involving a larval stage with metamorphosis.<br><br>40.

The root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like structure called the root cap which protects the tender apex of the root as it makes its way through the soil.<br><br>2. A few millimetres above the root cap is the region of meristematic activity with very small, thin-walled cells with dense protoplasm that divide repeatedly.<br><br>3. The cells proximal to the meristematic region undergo rapid elongation and enlargement and are responsible for the growth of the root in length and this region is called the region of elongation.<br><br>4. The cells of the elongation zone gradually differentiate and mature and this zone proximal to region of elongation is called the region of maturation.<br><br>5. From the region of maturation some of the epidermal cells form very fine and delicate thread-like structures called root hairs.<br><br>6. Root hairs absorb water and minerals from the soil.<br><br>7.

The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may bear two lateral small leaf like structures called stipules.<br><br>3. In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly.<br><br>4. In some leguminous plants the leaf base may become swollen which is called the pulvinus.<br><br>5. The petiole helps fold the blade in light.<br><br>6. Long thin flexible petioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind thereby cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface.<br><br>7. The lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded part of the leaf with veins and veinlets.<br><br>8. There is usually a middle prominent vein which is known as the midrib.<br><br>9. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade and act as channels of transport for water, minerals and food materials.<br><br>10. The shape, margin, apex, surface and extent of incision of lamina varies in different leaves.<br><br>11. The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation.<br><br>12. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate venation.<br><br>13. When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel venation.<br><br>14. Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons.<br><br>15.

Phyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of leaves on the stem or branch.<br><br>4. Phyllotaxy is usually of three types: alternate, opposite and whorled.<br><br>5. In alternate type of phyllotaxy, a single leaf arises at each node in alternate manner as in china rose, mustard and sun flower plants.<br><br>6. In opposite type of phyllotaxy, a pair of leaves arise at each node and lie opposite to each other as in Calotropis and guava plants.<br><br>7. If more than two leaves arise at a node and form a whorl, it is called whorled phyllotaxy as in Alstonia.<br><br>8.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The flower is the reproductive unit in the angiosperms and is meant for sexual reproduction.<br><br>2. A typical flower has four different kinds of whorls arranged successively on the swollen end of the stalk or pedicel called thalamus or receptacle.<br><br>3. The four whorls are calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium.<br><br>4. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive organs.<br><br>5. In some flowers like lily, the calyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth.<br><br>6. When a flower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is bisexual.<br><br>7. A flower having either only stamens or only carpels is unisexual.<br><br>8. In symmetry, the flower may be actinomorphic which means radial symmetry or zygomorphic which means bilateral symmetry.<br><br>9. When a flower can be divided into two equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it is said to be actinomorphic e.g. mustard, datura, chilli.<br><br>10. When a flower can be divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic e.g. pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia.<br><br>11. A flower is asymmetric or irregular if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical plane passing through the centre as in canna.<br><br>12. A flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when the floral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5 respectively.<br><br>13. Flowers with bracts which are reduced leaf found at the base of the pedicel are called bracteate.<br><br>14. Flowers without bracts are called ebracteate."],

In hypogynous flower, the gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated below it and the ovary is said to be superior e.g. mustard, china rose and brinjal.<br><br>3. In perigynous flowers, the gynoecium is situated in the centre and other parts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the same level and the ovary is said to be half inferior e.g. plum, rose, peach.<br><br>4. In epigynous flowers, the margin of thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused with it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary and the ovary is said to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber and the ray florets of sunflower.<br><br>5. Each flower normally has four floral whorls viz. calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium.<br><br>6. The calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called sepals.<br><br>7. Generally sepals are green, leaf-like and protect the flower in the bud stage.<br><br>8. The calyx may be gamosepalous when sepals are united or polysepalous when sepals are free.<br><br>9. Corolla is composed of petals which are usually brightly coloured to attract insects for pollination.<br><br>10. Like calyx, corolla may also be gamopetalous when petals are united or polypetalous when petals are free.<br><br>11.

A carpel consists of three parts namely stigma, style and ovary.<br><br>3. Ovary is the enlarged basal part on which lies the elongated tube called the style.<br><br>4. The style connects the ovary to the stigma.<br><br>5. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the receptive surface for pollen grains.<br><br>6. Each ovary bears one or more ovules attached to a flattened cushion like placenta.<br><br>7. When more than one carpel is present, they may be free as in lotus and rose and are called apocarpous.<br><br>8. Carpels are termed syncarpous when they are fused as in mustard and tomato.<br><br>9. After fertilisation, the ovules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.<br><br>10. The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known as placentation.<br><br>11. The placentation are of different types namely marginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central.<br><br>12. In marginal placentation, the placenta forms a ridge along the ventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge forming two rows as in pea.<br><br>13. When the placenta is axial and the ovules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentation is said to be axile as in china rose, tomato and lemon.<br><br>14. In parietal placentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or on peripheral part and ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-chambered due to the formation of the false septum e.g. mustard and Argemone.<br><br>15. When the ovules are borne on central axis and septa are absent as in Dianthus and Primrose, the placentation is called free central.<br><br>16. In basal placentation, the placenta develops at the base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it as in sunflower and marigold.<br><br>17. The fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants and it is a mature or ripened ovary developed after fertilisation.<br><br>18. If a fruit is formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit.<br><br>19. Generally the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The vascular system consists of complex tissues namely phloem and xylem.<br><br>2. Xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles.<br><br>3. In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem.<br><br>4. Vascular bundles with cambium can form secondary xylem and phloem tissues.<br><br>5. Vascular bundles that can form secondary tissues are called open vascular bundles.<br><br>6. In monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them.<br><br>7. Monocot vascular bundles do not form secondary tissues and are referred to as closed.<br><br>8. When xylem and phloem are arranged in alternate manner along different radii, the arrangement is called radial.<br><br>9. Radial arrangement of vascular bundles is found in roots.<br><br>10. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius.<br><br>11. Conjoint vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves.<br><br>12. Conjoint vascular bundles usually have phloem located only on outer side of xylem.<br><br>13. For better understanding of tissue organisation, it is convenient to study transverse sections of mature zones.<br><br>14. The outermost layer of dicotyledonous root is epiblema.<br><br>15. Many cells of epiblema protrude in the form of unicellular root hairs.<br><br>16. Epiblema is also called rhizodermis or piliferous layer.<br><br>17. Epiblema consists of several layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells.<br><br>18. Open vascular bundles possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem because of presence of cambium.<br><br>19.

Digestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted from the walls of the stomach.<br><br>3. Partially digested food called chyme is passed from stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum.<br><br>4. The duodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the pancreas through a common bile duct.<br><br>5. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic juices digest carbohydrates and proteins.<br><br>6. Final digestion takes place in the intestine.<br><br>7. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds in the inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli.<br><br>8. The undigested solid waste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.<br><br>9. Frogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods.<br><br>10. In water, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).<br><br>11. Dissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.<br><br>12. On land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.<br><br>13. The respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration.<br><br>14. The lungs are a pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper part of the trunk region (thorax).<br><br>15. Air enters through the nostrils into the buccal cavity and then to lungs.<br><br>16. During aestivation and hibernation gaseous exchange takes place through skin.<br><br>17. The vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type.<br><br>18. Frogs have a lymphatic system also.<br><br>19. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood vessels and blood.<br><br>20. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph channels and lymph nodes.<br><br>21. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the upper part of the body cavity.<br><br>22. It has three chambers, two atria and one ventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium.<br><br>23. A triangular structure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium and receives blood through the major veins called vena cava.<br><br>24. The ventricle opens into a sac-like conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart.<br><br>25. The blood from the heart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).<br><br>26. The veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form the venous system.<br><br>27. Special venous connection between liver and intestine as well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs.<br><br>28. The former is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal system.<br><br>29. The blood is composed of plasma and cells.<br><br>30. The blood cells are RBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes and platelets.<br><br>31. RBCs are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment namely haemoglobin.<br><br>32. The lymph is different from blood as it lacks few proteins and RBCs.<br><br>33.

Schwann concluded that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of plant cells based on his studies on plant tissues.<br><br>4. Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells.<br><br>5. Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory.<br><br>6. The cell theory formulated by Schleiden and Schwann did not explain how new cells were formed.<br><br>7.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. An improved model of cell membrane structure was proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972.<br><br>2. This model is widely accepted as fluid mosaic model.<br><br>3. According to fluid mosaic model the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within overall bilayer.<br><br>4. The ability to move within membrane is measured as its fluidity.<br><br>5. Fluid nature of membrane is important for functions like cell growth formation of intercellular junctions secretion endocytosis and cell division.<br><br>6. One of the most important functions of plasma membrane is transport of molecules across it.<br><br>7. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it.<br><br>8. Many molecules can move briefly across membrane without any requirement of energy called passive transport.<br><br>9. Neutral solutes may move across membrane by process of simple diffusion along concentration gradient.<br><br>10. Simple diffusion occurs from higher concentration to lower concentration.<br><br>11. Water also moves across membrane from higher to lower concentration.<br><br>12. Movement of water by diffusion is called osmosis.<br><br>13. Polar molecules cannot pass through nonpolar lipid bilayer.<br><br>14. Polar molecules require a carrier protein of membrane to facilitate their transport.<br><br>15. A few ions or molecules are transported across membrane against their concentration gradient.<br><br>16. Transport against gradient occurs from lower to higher concentration.<br><br>17. Such movement is an energy dependent process in which ATP is utilised.<br><br>18. Energy dependent transport is called active transport.<br><br>19. Example of active transport is Na plus K plus Pump.<br><br>20. A non-living rigid structure called cell wall forms outer covering over plasma membrane of fungi and plants.<br><br>21. Cell wall gives shape to cell and protects cell from mechanical damage and infection.<br><br>22. Cell wall helps in cell-to-cell interaction.<br><br>23. Cell wall provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules.<br><br>24. Algae have cell wall made of cellulose galactans mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate.<br><br>25. In other plants cell wall consists of cellulose hemicellulose pectins and proteins.<br><br>26. The cell wall of young plant cell is called primary wall which is capable of growth.<br><br>27. The primary wall capability of growth gradually diminishes as cell matures.<br><br>28. The secondary wall is formed on inner side towards membrane of cell.<br><br>29. The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate.<br><br>30. Middle lamella holds or glues different neighbouring cells together.<br><br>31. Cell wall and middle lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata.<br><br>32. Plasmodesmata connect the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. In higher classes, students learn how to analyse living tissue samples and identify particular organic compounds.<br><br>2. To identify a compound, one must extract it, then subject the extract to various separation techniques till the compound is separated from all other compounds.<br><br>3. One isolates and purifies a compound through various separation techniques.<br><br>4. Analytical techniques when applied to a compound give an idea of the molecular formula and probable structure of the compound.<br><br>5. All carbon compounds obtained from living tissues can be called biomolecules.<br><br>6. Living organisms also contain inorganic elements and compounds in them.<br><br>7. To detect inorganic elements, a slightly different but destructive experiment has to be done.<br><br>8. A small amount of living tissue such as a leaf or liver is weighed, and this weight is called wet weight.<br><br>9. When the tissue is dried, all water evaporates and the remaining material gives dry weight.<br><br>10. When tissue is fully burnt, all carbon compounds are oxidised to gaseous form like CO2 and water vapour and are removed.<br><br>11. What remains after fully burning tissue is called ash.<br><br>12. Ash contains inorganic elements like calcium and magnesium.<br><br>13. Inorganic compounds like sulphate and phosphate are also seen in the acid-soluble fraction.<br><br>14. Elemental analysis gives elemental composition of living tissues in the form of hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, carbon etc.<br><br>15. Analysis for compounds gives an idea of the kind of organic and inorganic constituents present in living tissues.<br><br>16. From a chemistry point of view, one can identify functional groups like aldehydes, ketones and aromatic compounds.<br><br>17. From a biological point of view, biomolecules are classified into amino acids, nucleotide bases, fatty acids etc.<br><br>18. Amino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and an acidic group as substituents on the same carbon.<br><br>19. The carbon atom bearing the amino and acidic groups is called alpha-carbon.<br><br>20. Amino acids with substituents on alpha-carbon are called alpha-amino acids.<br><br>21. Amino acids are substituted methanes.<br><br>22. There are four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions in amino acids.<br><br>23. The four substituent groups are hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group designated as R group.<br><br>24. Based on the nature of R group, there are many amino acids.<br><br>25. However, there are only twenty types of amino acids which are commonly found in living organisms.<br><br>26. According to Table 9.1, the percentage of carbon in earth's crust is 0.03 percent while in human body it is 18.5 percent.<br><br>27. According to Table 9.1, the percentage of hydrogen in earth's crust is 0.14 percent while in human body it is 0.5 percent.<br><br>28. According to Table 9.1, oxygen constitutes 46.6 percent in earth's crust and 65.0 percent in human body.<br><br>29. Nitrogen is present in very little amount in earth's crust but 3.3 percent in human body.<br><br>30. Silicon constitutes 27.7 percent in earth's crust but is negligible in human body.<br><br>31. Table 9.2 lists representative inorganic constituents of living tissues with their formulas.<br><br>32. Sodium ion is represented as Na+, potassium as K+, calcium as Ca2+ and magnesium as Mg2+ in living tissues.<br><br>33. Water with formula H2O is an important inorganic constituent of living tissues.<br><br>34. Inorganic compounds include NaCl, CaCO3, phosphate ion PO43- and sulphate ion SO42-."],

The R group in these amino acids could be a hydrogen atom in glycine, a methyl group in alanine, or hydroxy methyl in serine.<br><br>3. Three of the twenty amino acids are shown in Figure 9.1 of the NCERT textbook.<br><br>4. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially determined by the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups.<br><br>5. Based on the number of amino and carboxyl groups, amino acids can be acidic like glutamic acid, basic like lysine, or neutral like valine.<br><br>6. There are aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan.<br><br>7. A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of -NH2 and -COOH groups.<br><br>8. In solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes due to ionization.<br><br>9. The zwitterionic form of amino acids is represented as H3N+-CH-COO- with R group, where both positive and negative charges are present.<br><br>10. Lipids are generally water insoluble.<br><br>11. Lipids could be simple fatty acids.<br><br>12. A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group.<br><br>13. The R group in fatty acids could be a methyl group, ethyl group or higher number of -CH2 groups ranging from 1 carbon to 19 carbons.<br><br>14. Palmitic acid has 16 carbons including the carboxyl carbon.<br><br>15. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon.<br><br>16. Fatty acids could be saturated without double bond or unsaturated with one or more C=C double bonds.<br><br>17. Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane.<br><br>18. Many lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids.<br><br>19. Fatty acids are found esterified with glycerol in many lipids.<br><br>20. When fatty acids esterify with glycerol, they can form monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides.<br><br>21. Monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides are also called fats and oils based on melting point.<br><br>22. Oils have lower melting point, for example gingelly oil, and hence remain as oil in winters.<br><br>23. Some lipids have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them and are called phospholipids.<br><br>24. Phospholipids are found in cell membrane.<br><br>25. Lecithin is one example of a phospholipid.<br><br>26. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with more complex structures.<br><br>27. Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found.<br><br>28. Some heterocyclic ring compounds are nitrogen bases like adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil and thymine.<br><br>29. When nitrogen bases are found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides.<br><br>30. If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar along with nitrogen base, they are called nucleotides.<br><br>31. Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides.<br><br>32. Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides.<br><br>33.

The acid soluble pool and acid insoluble fraction together represent the entire chemical composition of living tissues or organisms.<br><br>9. If we represent the chemical composition of living tissue from abundance point of view and arrange them class-wise, we observe that water is the most abundant chemical in living organisms.<br><br>10. Table 9.4 shows the average composition of cells with percentage of the total cellular mass.<br><br>11. Water constitutes 70-90 percent of the total cellular mass.<br><br>12. Proteins constitute 10-15 percent of the total cellular mass.<br><br>13. Carbohydrates constitute 3 percent of the total cellular mass.<br><br>14. Lipids constitute 2 percent of the total cellular mass.<br><br>15. Nucleic acids constitute 5-7 percent of the total cellular mass.<br><br>16. Ions constitute 1 percent of the total cellular mass.<br><br>17. The correct order of chemical composition of living tissues in terms of percentage of total cellular mass is Water > Proteins > Nucleic acids > Carbohydrates > Lipids > Ions.<br><br>18. Proteins are polypeptides.<br><br>19. Proteins are linear chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in Figure 9.3.<br><br>20. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids.<br><br>21. There are 20 types of amino acids such as alanine, cysteine, proline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.<br><br>22. A protein is a heteropolymer and not a homopolymer because it has different types of amino acids.<br><br>23. A homopolymer has only one type of monomer repeating n number of times.<br><br>24. Certain amino acids are essential for our health and they have to be supplied through our diet.<br><br>25. Dietary proteins are the source of essential amino acids.<br><br>26. Amino acids can be essential or non-essential.<br><br>27. Non-essential amino acids are those which our body can make.<br><br>28. Essential amino acids are those which we get through our diet or food.<br><br>29. Proteins carry out many functions in living organisms such as transporting nutrients across cell membrane, fighting infectious organisms, acting as hormones and functioning as enzymes.<br><br>30. Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal world.<br><br>31. Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase or RuBisCO is the most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.<br><br>32. Table 9.5 shows some proteins and their functions.<br><br>33. Collagen functions as intercellular ground substance.<br><br>34. Trypsin is an enzyme.<br><br>35. Insulin is a hormone.<br><br>36.

Enzymes catalyse reactions at a high rate through their active site.<br><br>5. Enzyme catalysts differ from inorganic catalysts in many ways.<br><br>6. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures and high pressures.<br><br>7. Enzymes get damaged at high temperatures, say above 40 degree C.<br><br>8.

The metabolic pathway with one or two additional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products.<br><br>10.

The duration of cell cycle can vary from organism to organism and also from cell type to cell type.<br><br>3. Yeast cells can progress through the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes.<br><br>4. The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases: Interphase and M Phase (Mitosis phase).<br><br>5. The M Phase represents the phase when the actual cell division or mitosis occurs.<br><br>6. The interphase represents the phase between two successive M phases.<br><br>7. In the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of a human cell, cell division proper lasts for only about an hour.<br><br>8. The interphase lasts more than 95 percent of the duration of cell cycle.<br><br>9. The M Phase starts with nuclear division corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes called karyokinesis.<br><br>10. The M Phase usually ends with division of cytoplasm called cytokinesis.<br><br>11. The interphase is also called the resting phase as the cell is preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner.<br><br>12. The interphase is divided into three further phases: G1 phase (Gap 1), S phase (Synthesis), and G2 phase (Gap 2).<br><br>13. G1 phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication.<br><br>14.

However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid cells also divide by mitosis.<br><br>3. Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complement.<br><br>4. The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis.<br><br>5. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.<br><br>6. It becomes essential for the cell to divide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio.<br><br>7. A very significant contribution of mitosis is cell repair.<br><br>8. The cells of the upper layer of the epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly replaced by mitosis.<br><br>9. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues like the apical and the lateral cambium result in a continuous growth of plants throughout their life.<br><br>10. The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes.<br><br>11. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells.<br><br>12. The specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells and this kind of division is called meiosis.<br><br>13. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms.<br><br>14. Fertilisation restores the diploid phase.<br><br>15. Meiosis occurs during gametogenesis in plants and animals leading to the formation of haploid gametes.<br><br>16. Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication.<br><br>17. Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated to produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase.<br><br>18.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Prophase of the first meiotic division is typically longer and more complex when compared to prophase of mitosis.<br><br>2. Prophase I has been subdivided into five phases based on chromosomal behaviour: Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis.<br><br>3. During leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visible under the light microscope.<br><br>4. The compaction of chromosomes continues throughout leptotene.<br><br>5. The second stage of prophase I is called zygotene during which chromosomes start pairing together.<br><br>6. The process of association of chromosomes during zygotene is called synapsis.<br><br>7. Such paired chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes.<br><br>8. Chromosome synapsis is accompanied by the formation of complex structure called synaptonemal complex.<br><br>9. The complex formed by a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad.<br><br>10. The first two stages of prophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that is pachytene.<br><br>11. During pachytene stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent chromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appear as tetrads.<br><br>12. Pachytene stage is characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sites at which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes.<br><br>13. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes.<br><br>14. Crossing over is an enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called recombinase.<br><br>15. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material on the two chromosomes.<br><br>16. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving the chromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over.<br><br>17. The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of the synaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined homologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each other except at the sites of crossovers.<br><br>18. These X-shaped structures at the sites of crossovers are called chiasmata.<br><br>19. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last for months or years.<br><br>20. The final stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis which is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata.<br><br>21. During diakinesis the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation.<br><br>22. By the end of diakinesis, the nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down.<br><br>23. Diakinesis represents transition to metaphase.<br><br>24. During metaphase I, the bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate.<br><br>25.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was known that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO2 and water.<br><br>10. The empirical equation for photosynthesis in oxygen evolving organisms is CO2 + H2O ---Light---> [CH2O] + O2, where [CH2O] represents a carbohydrate like glucose.<br><br>11.

Van Niel showed that hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates in photosynthesis.<br><br>14.

Photo-phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of light.<br><br>3. When the two photosystems work in a series, first PS II and then PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs.<br><br>4. In non-cyclic photophosphorylation, the two photosystems are connected through an electron transport chain as seen in the Z scheme.<br><br>5. Both ATP and NADPH + H positive are synthesised by non-cyclic electron flow.<br><br>6. When only PS I is functional, the electron is circulated within the photosystem and phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of electrons.<br><br>7. A possible location where cyclic photophosphorylation could be happening is in the stroma lamellae.<br><br>8. While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS II, the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP positive reductase enzyme.<br><br>9. In cyclic photophosphorylation, the excited electron does not pass on to NADP positive but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain.<br><br>10.

CF0 is embedded in the thylakoid membrane and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane.<br><br>3. CF1 protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma.<br><br>4. The breakdown of the proton gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the CF1 particle of the ATP synthase.<br><br>5. The conformational change in CF1 makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy-packed ATP.<br><br>6. Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATP synthase.<br><br>7. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen.<br><br>8. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane.<br><br>9. The diffusion of protons releases enough energy to activate ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP.<br><br>10. The products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and oxygen.<br><br>11. Of the products of light reaction, oxygen diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to synthesis of food or sugars.<br><br>12.

In C4 plants, the Calvin pathway does not take place in mesophyll cells but occurs only in bundle sheath cells.<br><br>4. Photorespiration is one process that creates an important difference between C3 and C4 plants.<br><br>5. The first CO2 fixation step of Calvin pathway is the reaction where RuBP combines with CO2 to form 2 molecules of 3PGA.<br><br>6. This reaction is catalysed by RuBisCO enzyme.<br><br>7. RuBisCO is the most abundant enzyme in the world.<br><br>8. RuBisCO is characterized by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2.<br><br>9. RuBisCO stands for Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase.<br><br>10. RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the CO2:O2 ratio is nearly equal.<br><br>11. The binding of CO2 and O2 to RuBisCO is competitive.<br><br>12. The relative concentration of O2 and CO2 determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme.<br><br>13. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO and hence CO2 fixation is decreased.<br><br>14. When RuBP binds with O2 instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA, it forms one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 carbon).<br><br>15. The pathway where RuBP binds with O2 is called photorespiration.<br><br>16. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars nor of ATP.<br><br>17. Photorespiration results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP.<br><br>18. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH.<br><br>19. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet.<br><br>20. In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur.<br><br>21. C4 plants have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site.<br><br>22. In C4 plants, the C4 acid from mesophyll is broken down in bundle sheath cells to release CO2 resulting in increasing the intracellular concentration of CO2.<br><br>23. Increasing intracellular CO2 concentration ensures that RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity.<br><br>24. C4 plants lack photorespiration therefore productivity and yields are better in these plants.<br><br>25. C4 plants show tolerance to higher temperatures.<br><br>26.

Aerobic respiration releases CO2, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate.<br><br>3. Aerobic respiration is most common in higher organisms.<br><br>4. In eukaryotes, aerobic respiration steps take place within the mitochondria and require O2.<br><br>5. For aerobic respiration, the final product of glycolysis pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria.<br><br>6. The complete oxidation of pyruvate occurs by the stepwise removal of all the hydrogen atoms leaving three molecules of CO2.<br><br>7. The electrons removed as part of the hydrogen atoms are passed on to molecular O2 with simultaneous synthesis of ATP.<br><br>8. The first process of aerobic respiration takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria.<br><br>9. The second process of aerobic respiration is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria.<br><br>10. Pyruvate is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates in the cytosol.<br><br>11. After pyruvate enters mitochondrial matrix, it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation.<br><br>12. Oxidative decarboxylation is catalysed by a complex set of reactions by pyruvic dehydrogenase.<br><br>13. The reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase require the participation of several coenzymes including NAD+ and Coenzyme A.<br><br>14. The conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl CoA is: Pyruvic acid + CoA + NAD+ ---Pyruvate dehydrogenase---> Acetyl CoA + CO2 + NADH + H+.<br><br>15. Two molecules of NADH are produced from the metabolism of two molecules of pyruvic acid produced from one glucose molecule during glycolysis.<br><br>16. The acetyl CoA then enters a cyclic pathway called tricarboxylic acid cycle.<br><br>17. Tricarboxylic acid cycle is more commonly called as Krebs cycle after the scientist Hans Krebs who first elucidated it.<br><br>18. The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic acid and water to yield citric acid.<br><br>19. The reaction yielding citric acid is catalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released.<br><br>20. Citrate is then isomerised to isocitrate.<br><br>21.

The ratio of the volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration is called the respiratory quotient or RQ.<br><br>3. Respiratory quotient is also known as respiratory ratio.<br><br>4. The formula for RQ is: RQ = volume of CO2 evolved divided by volume of O2 consumed.<br><br>5. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory substrate used during respiration.<br><br>6. When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely oxidised, the RQ will be 1.<br><br>7. RQ is 1 for carbohydrates because equal amounts of CO2 and O2 are evolved and consumed respectively.<br><br>8. Figure 12.6 shows the interrelationship among metabolic pathways showing respiration mediated breakdown of different organic molecules to CO2 and H2O.<br><br>9. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol as shown in the figure.<br><br>10. Carbohydrates are converted into simple sugars like glucose as shown in the figure.<br><br>11. Proteins are broken down into amino acids as shown in the figure.<br><br>12. Glucose is converted to glucose 6-phosphate in the respiratory pathway.<br><br>13. Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.<br><br>14. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxy acetone phosphate.<br><br>15.

Pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA.<br><br>18. Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle.<br><br>19. The Krebs cycle ultimately produces CO2 and H2O.<br><br>20. Fatty acids and glycerol from fat breakdown eventually lead to formation of pyruvic acid and then acetyl CoA.<br><br>21.

In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division, only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and matures.<br><br>3. The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate.<br><br>4. On plotting the length of the organ against time in arithmetic growth, a linear curve is obtained.<br><br>5. Arithmetic growth is mathematically expressed as Lt = L0 + rt, where Lt is length at time t, L0 is length at time zero, and r is growth rate per unit time.<br><br>6. In geometrical growth, in most systems, the initial growth is slow (lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter at an exponential rate (log or exponential phase).<br><br>7. In geometrical growth, both the progeny cells following mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so.<br><br>8. With limited nutrient supply, the growth slows down leading to a stationary phase.<br><br>9. When the parameter of growth is plotted against time in geometrical growth, we get a typical sigmoid or S-curve.<br><br>10. A sigmoid curve is a characteristic of living organism growing in a natural environment.<br><br>11. A sigmoid curve is typical for all cells, tissues and organs of a plant.<br><br>12.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The part starting with external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitutes the conducting part of the respiratory system.<br><br>2. The alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system.<br><br>3. The conducting part transports atmospheric air to the alveoli.<br><br>4. The conducting part clears air from foreign particles, humidifies it, and brings it to body temperature.<br><br>5. The exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between blood and atmospheric air.<br><br>6. The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically an air-tight chamber.<br><br>7. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the vertebral column.<br><br>8. The thoracic chamber is formed ventrally by the sternum.<br><br>9. The thoracic chamber is formed laterally by the ribs.<br><br>10. The thoracic chamber is formed on the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm.<br><br>11. Any change in the volume of thoracic cavity is reflected in the lung or pulmonary cavity.<br><br>12. This arrangement is essential for breathing as we cannot directly alter the pulmonary volume.<br><br>13. Respiration involves five main steps: breathing, diffusion across alveolar membrane, transport of gases, diffusion between blood and tissues, and cellular respiration.<br><br>14. Breathing or pulmonary ventilation is the process by which atmospheric air is drawn in and carbon dioxide rich alveolar air is released out.<br><br>15. Diffusion of gases oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs across alveolar membrane.<br><br>16. Transport of gases is carried out by the blood.<br><br>17. Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs between blood and tissues.<br><br>18. Utilisation of oxygen by cells for catabolic reactions and resultant release of carbon dioxide is called cellular respiration.<br><br>19. Breathing involves two stages: inspiration and expiration.<br><br>20. Inspiration is the stage during which atmospheric air is drawn in.<br><br>21. Expiration is the stage by which alveolar air is released out.<br><br>22. Movement of air into and out of lungs is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between the lungs and atmosphere.<br><br>23. Inspiration occurs when the intra-pulmonary pressure is less than atmospheric pressure, creating negative pressure in lungs.<br><br>24. Expiration takes place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure.<br><br>25. The diaphragm and specialized set of muscles (external and internal intercostals between ribs) help in generation of pressure gradients.<br><br>26. Inspiration is initiated by contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis.<br><br>27. Contraction of external intercostal muscles lifts up the ribs and sternum during inspiration.<br><br>28. The inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung surface.<br><br>29.

About 70 percent of CO2 is carried as bicarbonate.<br><br>6. About 7 percent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.<br><br>7. Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the RBCs.<br><br>8. O2 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form oxyhaemoglobin.<br><br>9. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of four molecules of O2.<br><br>10. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily related to partial pressure of O2.<br><br>11. Partial pressure of CO2, H+ concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere with oxygen binding to haemoglobin.<br><br>12. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the pO2.<br><br>13. This curve is called the O2 dissociation curve and is highly useful in studying the effect of various factors on oxygen binding.<br><br>14. In the alveoli, high pO2, low pCO2, lesser H+ concentration and lower temperature favour the formation of oxyhaemoglobin.<br><br>15. In the tissues, low pO2, high pCO2, high H+ concentration and higher temperature favour the dissociation of oxygen from oxyhaemoglobin.<br><br>16. O2 gets bound to haemoglobin in the lung surface.<br><br>17. O2 gets dissociated from oxyhaemoglobin at the tissues.<br><br>18.

In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra.<br><br>10. Kidneys are reddish brown, bean shaped structures situated between the levels of last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra.<br><br>11. Kidneys are located close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity.<br><br>12. Each kidney of an adult human measures 10-12 cm in length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in thickness with an average weight of 120-170 grams.<br><br>13. Towards the centre of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum through which ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter.<br><br>14. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel shaped space called the renal pelvis with projections called calyces.<br><br>15. The outer layer of kidney is a tough capsule.<br><br>16. Inside the kidney, there are two zones: an outer cortex and an inner medulla.<br><br>17. The medulla is divided into a few conical masses called medullary pyramids projecting into the calyces.<br><br>18. The singular form of calyces is calyx.<br><br>19.

The ascending limb of Henles loop continues as another highly coiled tubular region called distal convoluted tubule or DCT.<br><br>4. The distal convoluted tubules of many nephrons open into a straight tube called collecting duct.<br><br>5. Many collecting ducts converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids in the calyces.<br><br>6. The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT of the nephron are situated in the cortical region of the kidney.<br><br>7. The loop of Henle dips into the medulla region of the kidney.<br><br>8. In majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and extends only very little into the medulla. Such nephrons are called cortical nephrons.<br><br>9. In some nephrons, the loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxtamedullary nephrons.<br><br>10. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular capillaries.<br><br>11. A minute vessel of the peritubular capillary network runs parallel to the Henles loop forming a U shaped vasa recta.<br><br>12. Vasa recta is absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons.<br><br>13. Urine formation involves three main processes: glomerular filtration, reabsorption and secretion that takes place in different parts of the nephron.<br><br>14. The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood which is carried out by the glomerulus and is called glomerular filtration.<br><br>15.

GFR in a healthy individual is approximately 125 ml per minute, i.e., 180 litres per day.<br><br>3. The kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular filtration rate.<br><br>4. Juxta glomerular apparatus (JGA) is a special sensitive region formed by cellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent arteriole at the location of their contact.<br><br>5. A fall in GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR back to normal.<br><br>6. The volume of filtrate formed per day is 180 litres while urine released is 1.5 litres, suggesting that nearly 99 per cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules.<br><br>7. The process by which nearly 99 per cent of filtrate is reabsorbed by renal tubules is called reabsorption.<br><br>8. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform reabsorption either by active or passive mechanisms.<br><br>9. Substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+ etc. in the filtrate are reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport.<br><br>10. Reabsorption of water occurs passively in the initial segments of the nephron.<br><br>11. During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H+, K+ and ammonia into the filtrate.<br><br>12. Tubular secretion is an important step in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid base balance of body fluids.<br><br>13. Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption.<br><br>14. Nearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed by PCT segment.<br><br>15. PCT helps to maintain the pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion of hydrogen ions and ammonia into the filtrate and by absorption of HCO3- from it.<br><br>16. In Henles loop, reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb.<br><br>17.

The ascending limb of Henles loop is impermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or passively.<br><br>21. As the concentrated filtrate passes upward in the ascending limb, it gets diluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary fluid.<br><br>22. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) performs conditional reabsorption of Na+ and water.<br><br>23.

The proximity between the Henles loop and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium.<br><br>3. The osmolarity increases from 300 mOsmolL-1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL-1 in the inner medulla.<br><br>4. This osmolarity gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea.<br><br>5. NaCl is transported by the ascending limb of Henles loop which is exchanged with the descending limb of vasa recta.<br><br>6. NaCl is returned to the interstitium by the ascending portion of vasa recta.<br><br>7. Small amounts of urea enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henles loop.<br><br>8. The urea that enters the ascending limb is transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule.<br><br>9. The transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement of Henles loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism.<br><br>10. The counter current mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient in the kidney.<br><br>11. The osmolarity at different levels shows progressive increase: 300 mOsmolL-1 at cortex, 600 mOsmolL-1 at outer medulla, 900 mOsmolL-1 deeper in medulla, and 1200 mOsmolL-1 at inner medulla.<br><br>12. The counter current mechanism involves flow in opposite directions in the two limbs of both Henles loop and vasa recta.<br><br>13. The osmolarity increases approximately 4 times from cortex to inner medulla.<br><br>14. Both the nephron and vasa recta show osmolarity values ranging from 300 to 1200 mOsmolL-1.<br><br>15. The exchange of NaCl between ascending limb of Henles loop and descending limb of vasa recta represents counter current exchange.<br><br>16. The special arrangement of Henles loop and vasa recta facilitates transport of substances while maintaining osmotic gradient.<br><br>17. Water reabsorption occurs at different segments of the nephron as shown in the diagram.<br><br>18. The counter current pattern exists in both Henles loop and vasa recta which is essential for urine concentration.<br><br>19. The diagrammatic representation shows the counter current mechanisms in nephron and vasa recta with osmolarity gradients clearly marked.<br><br>20. The interstitium receives NaCl from ascending portion of vasa recta and urea from collecting tubule to maintain high osmolarity in inner medulla."],

Since gametes are non-motile, they have to be brought together for fertilisation to occur through pollination.<br><br>17. Pollination is the mechanism to achieve the objective of bringing gametes together.<br><br>18. Transfer of pollen grains shed from the anther to the stigma of a pistil is termed pollination.<br><br>19. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array of adaptations to achieve pollination using external agents.<br><br>20. Depending on the source of pollen, pollination can be divided into three types.<br><br>21. Autogamy is the type of pollination achieved within the same flower.<br><br>22. In autogamy, transfer of pollen grains occurs from the anther to the stigma of the same flower.<br><br>23. In a normal flower which opens and exposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather rare.<br><br>24. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release and stigma receptivity.<br><br>25. For autogamy, the anthers and the stigma should lie close to each other."],

The moth deposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower gets pollinated by the moth.<br><br>3. The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as the seeds start developing.<br><br>4. Floral visitors that consume pollen or nectar without bringing about pollination are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers.<br><br>5. Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite flowers.<br><br>6. Pollen grains in hermaphrodite flowers are likely to come in contact with the stigma of the same flower.<br><br>7. Continued self-pollination results in inbreeding depression.<br><br>8. Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-pollination and to encourage cross-pollination.<br><br>9. In some species, pollen release and stigma receptivity are not synchronised - either released before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive much before the release of pollen.<br><br>10. In some other species, the anther and stigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in contact with the stigma of the same flower.<br><br>11. Both these devices (dichogamy and herkogamy) prevent autogamy.<br><br>12. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.<br><br>13. Self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism that prevents self-pollen from the same flower or other flowers of the same plant from fertilising the ovules.<br><br>14. Self-incompatibility works by inhibiting pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil.<br><br>15. Another device to prevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers.<br><br>16.

In monoecious plants, unisexual flowers prevent autogamy but not geitonogamy.<br><br>18. In several species such as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants, that is each plant is either male or female, called dioecious.<br><br>19. The dioecious condition prevents both autogamy and geitonogamy.<br><br>20. Pollination does not guarantee the transfer of the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the stigma).<br><br>21.

In plants shedding pollen at two-celled condition, the generative cell divides and forms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma.<br><br>3. In plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes carry the two male gametes from the beginning.<br><br>4. Pollen tube, after reaching the ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle.<br><br>5. The pollen tube then enters one of the synergids through the filiform apparatus.<br><br>6. Filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube.<br><br>7. All events from pollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule are together referred to as pollen-pistil interaction.<br><br>8. Pollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition followed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen.<br><br>9. The knowledge gained in pollen-pistil interaction would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil interaction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.<br><br>10. Pollen germination can be easily studied by dusting pollen from flowers such as pea, chickpea, Coriander, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide containing a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent).<br><br>11. After about 15-30 minutes, pollen tubes can be observed coming out of the pollen grains under microscope.<br><br>12. A breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera to combine desirable characters to produce commercially superior varieties.<br><br>13. Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop improvement programme.<br><br>14. In artificial hybridisation experiments, it is important to ensure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination from unwanted pollen.<br><br>15. Protection from unwanted pollen is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.<br><br>16. If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is necessary.<br><br>17. This step of removing anthers is referred to as emasculation.<br><br>18. Emasculated flowers have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen.<br><br>19. This process is called bagging.<br><br>20. When the stigma of bagged flower attains receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent are dusted on the stigma.<br><br>21. After pollination, the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits are allowed to develop.<br><br>22. If the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for emasculation.<br><br>23.

The portion of the embryonal axis above the level of attachment of scutellum is the epicotyl.<br><br>3. Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a few leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile.<br><br>4. In angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction.<br><br>5. The seed is often described as a fertilised ovule.<br><br>6. Seeds are formed inside fruits.<br><br>7. A seed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.<br><br>8. The cotyledons of the embryo are simple structures, generally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves as in legumes.<br><br>9. Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous.<br><br>10. Non-albuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely consumed during embryo development, e.g., pea, groundnut.<br><br>11. Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used up during embryo development, e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor.<br><br>12. In some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of nucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the perisperm.<br><br>13. Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats.<br><br>14. The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat which facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination.<br><br>15. As the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become relatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass).<br><br>16. The general metabolic activity of the embryo slows down as seeds mature.<br><br>17. The embryo may enter a state of inactivity called dormancy.<br><br>18. If favourable conditions are available (adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), the embryo germinates.<br><br>19. As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit.<br><br>20. The transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds simultaneously.<br><br>21. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called pericarp.<br><br>22. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc.<br><br>23. The fruits may be dry as in groundnut and mustard.<br><br>24.

Mammary glands contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat.<br><br>4. The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15 to 20 mammary lobes.<br><br>5. Each mammary lobe contains clusters of cells called alveoli.<br><br>6. The cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in the cavities or lumens of alveoli.<br><br>7. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.<br><br>8. The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct.<br><br>9. Several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla.<br><br>10. The mammary ampulla is connected to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.<br><br>11. Gametogenesis is the process by which gametes are produced in primary sex organs.<br><br>12. The primary sex organs are testis in males and ovaries in females.<br><br>13. Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm formation in testis that begins at puberty.<br><br>14. The immature male germ cells are called spermatogonia.<br><br>15. Spermatogonia are present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules.<br><br>16. Spermatogonia multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers.<br><br>17. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes.<br><br>18. Some of the spermatogonia are called primary spermatocytes.<br><br>19. Primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis.<br><br>20. A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division called reduction division.<br><br>21. First meiotic division leads to formation of two equal haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes.<br><br>22. Secondary spermatocytes have only 23 chromosomes each.<br><br>23. Secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal haploid spermatids.<br><br>24. Spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa or sperms by the process called spermiogenesis.<br><br>25. After spermiogenesis, sperm heads become embedded in the Sertoli cells.<br><br>26. Sperms are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation.<br><br>27. Spermatogenesis starts at puberty due to significant increase in secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone or GnRH.<br><br>28. GnRH is a hypothalamic hormone.<br><br>29. Increased levels of GnRH act at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulate secretion of two gonadotropins - luteinising hormone or LH and follicle stimulating hormone or FSH.<br><br>30.

A mature sperm is a microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, middle piece and tail.<br><br>3. A plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm.<br><br>4. The sperm head contains an elongated haploid nucleus.<br><br>5. The anterior portion of sperm nucleus is covered by a cap-like structure called acrosome.<br><br>6. The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help fertilisation of the ovum.<br><br>7. The middle piece possesses numerous mitochondria which produce energy for movement of tail.<br><br>8.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The secretion of gonadotropins LH and FSH increases gradually during the follicular phase.<br><br>2. LH and FSH stimulate follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles.<br><br>3. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle at about 14th day.<br><br>4. Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle is called LH surge.<br><br>5. LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum called ovulation.<br><br>6. The ovulation or ovulatory phase is followed by the luteal phase.<br><br>7. During luteal phase, the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform into the corpus luteum.<br><br>8. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone.<br><br>9. Progesterone is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.<br><br>10. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy.<br><br>11. During pregnancy all events of the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation.<br><br>12. In the absence of pregnancy, the rapture of the endometrium leads to menstruation, marking a new cycle.<br><br>13. In human beings, menstrual cycles cease around 50 years of age and that is termed as menopause.<br><br>14. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal reproductive phase.<br><br>15. Cyclic menstruation extends between menarche and menopause.<br><br>16. During copulation or coitus, semen is released by the penis into the vagina called insemination.<br><br>17. The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix, enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube.<br><br>18. The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region.<br><br>19. Fertilisation takes place in the ampullary region of fallopian tube.<br><br>20. Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region.<br><br>21. This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy.<br><br>22. The process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation.<br><br>23. During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum.<br><br>24. The contact induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms.<br><br>25. It ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum.<br><br>26. The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the membrane and the zona pellucida."],

The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst as it moves further into the uterus.<br><br>3. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast.<br><br>4. The inner group of cells attached to trophoblast is called the inner cell mass.<br><br>5. The trophoblast layer gets attached to the endometrium.<br><br>6. The inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo after attachment.<br><br>7. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and cover the blastocyst.<br><br>8. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the endometrium of the uterus.<br><br>9. This embedding of blastocyst is called implantation.<br><br>10. Implantation leads to pregnancy.<br><br>11. After implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called chorionic villi.<br><br>12. The chorionic villi are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal blood.<br><br>13.

A mesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm.<br><br>3. These three layers give rise to all tissues and organs in adults.<br><br>4. The inner cell mass contains certain cells which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.<br><br>5. The human pregnancy lasts 9 months.<br><br>6. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryos heart is formed.<br><br>7. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening to the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope.<br><br>8. By the end of the second month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits.<br><br>9. By the end of 12 weeks or first trimester, most of the major organ systems are formed.<br><br>10. The limbs and external genital organs are well-developed by the end of first trimester.<br><br>11. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head are observed during the fifth month.<br><br>12. By the end of about 24 weeks or end of second trimester, the body is covered with fine hair, eye-lids separate and eyelashes are formed.<br><br>13. By the end of nine months of pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.<br><br>14. The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months which is called the gestation period.<br><br>15. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsion or delivery of the foetus.<br><br>16. The process of delivery of the foetus or childbirth is called parturition.<br><br>17. Parturition is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism.<br><br>18. The signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta.<br><br>19. These signals induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex.<br><br>20. The foetal ejection reflex triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary.<br><br>21. Oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions.<br><br>22. The stronger contractions stimulate further secretion of oxytocin.<br><br>23. The stimulatory reflex between the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions.<br><br>24. This leads to expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal called parturition.<br><br>25. Soon after the infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus.<br><br>26. The mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy.<br><br>27. The mammary glands start producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by the process called lactation.<br><br>28. Lactation helps the mother in feeding the new-born baby.<br><br>29. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called colostrum.<br><br>30.

Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically assisted deliveries and better post-natal care have led to decreased maternal and infant mortality rates.<br><br>2. Increased number of couples with small families, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical facilities for all sex-related problems have led to an improved reproductive health of the society.<br><br>3. In the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly improved the quality of life of the people.<br><br>4. Increased health facilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on the growth of population.<br><br>5.

India's population which was approximately 350 million at the time of independence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed 1.2 billion in May 2011.<br><br>7. A rapid decline in maternal mortality rate MMR and infant mortality rate IMR as well as an increase in number of people in reproductive age are probable reasons for population increase.<br><br>8. Through Reproductive Child Health RCH programme, though we could bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal.<br><br>9. According to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was less than 2 per cent i.e. 20 per 1000 per year, a rate at which our population could increase rapidly.<br><br>10. An alarming growth rate could lead to an absolute scarcity of even the basic requirements i.e. food, shelter and clothing if not checked.<br><br>11. The government was forced to take up serious measures to check the population growth rate.<br><br>12. The most important step to overcome the population problem is to motivate smaller families by using various contraceptive methods.<br><br>13. Advertisements in the media as well as posters showing a happy couple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do meaning we two, our two were used to promote small family norms.<br><br>14.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Natural contraceptive methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum and sperms meeting.<br><br>2. Periodic abstinence is a method in which the couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual cycle when ovulation could be expected.<br><br>3. The period from day 10 to 17 of menstrual cycle is called the fertile period as chances of fertilisation are very high during this period.<br><br>4. By abstaining from coitus during the fertile period, conception could be prevented in periodic abstinence method.<br><br>5. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is a method in which the male partner withdraws his penis from the vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid insemination.<br><br>6. Lactational amenorrhea means absence of menstruation and this method is based on the fact that ovulation and therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of intense lactation following parturition.<br><br>7. As long as the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of conception are almost nil in lactational amenorrhea method.<br><br>8. Lactational amenorrhea method has been reported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six months following parturition.<br><br>9. In natural contraceptive methods, side effects are almost nil but chances of failure are high.<br><br>10. In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with the help of barriers.<br><br>11. Barrier contraceptive methods are available for both males and females.<br><br>12. Condoms are barriers made of thin rubber latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or vagina and cervix in the female just before coitus so that the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female reproductive tract.<br><br>13. Nirodh is a popular brand of condom for the males.<br><br>14. Use of condoms has increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of protecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS.<br><br>15. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are barriers made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive tract to cover the cervix during coitus.<br><br>16. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults prevent conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the cervix.<br><br>17. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are reusable contraceptive devices.<br><br>18. Spermicidal creams, jellies and foams are usually combined with barriers like diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults to increase their contraceptive efficiency.<br><br>19. Intra Uterine Devices IUDs are effective and popular contraceptive methods that are inserted by doctors or expert nurses in the uterus through vagina.<br><br>20. Non-medicated IUDs include Lippes loop as an example.<br><br>21. Copper releasing IUDs include CuT, Cu7 and Multiload 375 as examples.<br><br>22. Hormone releasing IUDs include Progestasert and LNG-20 as examples.<br><br>23. IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms within the uterus as their mechanism of contraceptive action.<br><br>24. Copper releasing IUDs release copper ions that suppress sperm motility and the fertilising capacity of sperms.<br><br>25. Hormone releasing IUDs have additional contraceptive mechanisms besides increasing phagocytosis."],

IUDs are ideal contraceptives for the females who want to delay pregnancy or space children.<br><br>3. IUD is one of most widely accepted methods of contraception in India.<br><br>4. Oral administration of small doses of either progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations is another contraceptive method used by the females.<br><br>5. Oral contraceptives are used in the form of tablets and hence are popularly called pills.<br><br>6. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days starting preferably within the first five days of menstrual cycle.<br><br>7. After a gap of 7 days during which menstruation occurs, pills have to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to prevent conception.<br><br>8. Pills inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent or retard entry of sperms.<br><br>9. Pills are very effective with lesser side-effects and are well accepted by females.<br><br>10. Saheli is the new oral contraceptive for the females that contains a non-steroidal preparation.<br><br>11. Saheli is a once a week pill with very few side-effects and high contraceptive value.<br><br>12. Saheli works by blocking estrogen receptors in the uterus preventing eggs from getting implanted.<br><br>13. Progestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used by females as injections or implants under the skin.<br><br>14. The mode of action of progestogen injections or implants is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are much longer.<br><br>15. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be very effective as emergency contraceptives.<br><br>16. Emergency contraceptives could be used to avoid possible pregnancy due to rapes or casual unprotected intercourse.<br><br>17. Surgical methods are also called sterilisation and are generally advised for the male or female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more pregnancies.<br><br>18. Vasectomy is the surgical sterilization method performed in males.<br><br>19. Tubectomy is the surgical sterilization method performed in females.<br><br>20. In tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is removed or tied up.<br><br>21. Surgical methods like vasectomy and tubectomy block gamete transport.<br><br>22. Vasectomy does not prevent spermatogenesis but prevents sperm transport by blocking vas deferens.<br><br>23.

Lack of timely detection and proper treatment could lead to complications like pelvic inflammatory diseases PID, abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer of the reproductive tract.<br><br>14. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society.<br><br>15. Prevention or early detection and cure of STIs are given prime consideration under the reproductive health care programmes.<br><br>16. Though all persons are vulnerable to STIs, their incidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group of 15-24 years.<br><br>17. Prevention of STIs is possible by following simple guidelines.<br><br>18. To avoid transmission of STIs, one should avoid sex with unknown partners or multiple partners.<br><br>19. To avoid transmission of STIs, one should always try to use condoms during coitus.<br><br>20. In case of doubt regarding STI, one should go to a qualified doctor for early detection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection.<br><br>21. A discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of infertility.<br><br>22.

The reasons for infertility could be many including physical, congenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological factors.<br><br>3. In India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but more often than not, the problem lies in the male partner.<br><br>4. Specialised health care units like infertility clinics could help in diagnosis and corrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to have children.<br><br>5. Where such corrections are not possible, the couples could be assisted to have children through certain special techniques commonly known as assisted reproductive technologies ART.<br><br>6. In vitro fertilisation IVF means fertilisation outside the body in almost similar conditions as that in the body followed by embryo transfer ET.<br><br>7. IVF technique is popularly known as test tube baby programme.<br><br>8. In IVF, ova from the wife or donor female and sperms from the husband or donor male are collected and are induced to form zygote under simulated conditions in the laboratory.<br><br>9. The zygote or early embryo with upto 8 blastomeres could then be transferred into the fallopian tube which is called ZIFT meaning zygote intra fallopian transfer.<br><br>10. Embryos with more than 8 blastomeres are transferred into the uterus using IUT meaning intra uterine transfer to complete its further development.<br><br>11. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation meaning fusion of gametes within the female also could be used for transfer to assist those females who cannot conceive.<br><br>12. GIFT means gamete intra fallopian transfer in which an ovum collected from a donor is transferred into the fallopian tube of another female who cannot produce one but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and further development.<br><br>13. ICSI means intra cytoplasmic sperm injection which is another specialised procedure to form an embryo in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.<br><br>14. ICSI is an in-vitro fertilization technique not in-vivo fertilization.<br><br>15. Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates could be corrected by artificial insemination AI technique.<br><br>16. In artificial insemination AI technique, the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus IUI meaning intra-uterine insemination of the female.<br><br>17. ART techniques involving in vitro fertilization include ZIFT, ICSI and IUT but not GIFT and IUI.<br><br>18. IUD is not an example of Assisted Reproductive Technology ART as it is a contraceptive device.<br><br>19. All ART techniques require extremely high precision handling by specialised professionals and expensive instrumentation.<br><br>20. ART facilities are presently available only in very few centres in the country and their benefits are affordable to only a limited number of people.<br><br>21. Emotional, religious and social factors are also obstacles in the adoption of ART methods.<br><br>22. Since the ultimate aim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many orphaned and destitute children who would probably not survive till maturity unless taken care of.<br><br>23.

Erwin Chargaff observed that for double stranded DNA, the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine are constant and equals one.<br><br>14. The two polynucleotide chains are complementary to each other.<br><br>15. If the sequence of bases in one strand is known, the sequence in other strand can be predicted.<br><br>16. Each strand of DNA acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand.<br><br>17. The DNA double helix is made of two polynucleotide chains where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate and bases project inside.<br><br>18. The two chains have anti-parallel polarity.<br><br>19. If one chain has polarity 5 prime to 3 prime, the other has 3 prime to 5 prime.<br><br>20. Bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bonds forming base pairs.<br><br>21. Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine from opposite strand.<br><br>22. Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three hydrogen bonds.<br><br>23. A purine always comes opposite to a pyrimidine in DNA base pairing.<br><br>24. Purine-pyrimidine pairing generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix.<br><br>25. The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion.<br><br>26. The pitch of the DNA helix is 3.4 nm.<br><br>27. There are roughly 10 base pairs in each turn of the helix."],

The two properties of genetic code that create difficulty in reverse prediction are degeneracy and unambiguous nature.<br><br>3. Relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation studies.<br><br>4. Effects of large deletions and rearrangements in a DNA segment are easy to comprehend.<br><br>5. Large deletions or rearrangements may result in loss or gain of a gene and its function.<br><br>6. The effect of point mutations can be explained through specific examples.<br><br>7. A classical example of point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin chain.<br><br>8. Point mutation in beta globin gene results in change of amino acid residue from glutamate to valine.<br><br>9. The point mutation in beta globin chain results in a diseased condition called sickle cell anemia.<br><br>10. Effect of point mutations that insert or delete a base in structural gene can be better understood by following simple examples.<br><br>11. The genetic code can be understood through an analogy where each word has three letters like codons.<br><br>12. Insertion of one letter (base) between words changes the reading frame from that point onwards.<br><br>13. Insertion of two letters (bases) at the same place also changes the reading frame.<br><br>14. Insertion of three letters (bases) together restores the reading frame and adds one word (amino acid).<br><br>15. Deletion of one base changes the reading frame from the point of deletion.<br><br>16. Deletion of two bases also changes the reading frame from deletion point.<br><br>17. Deletion of three bases removes one word (amino acid) but maintains reading frame.<br><br>18. Insertion or deletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of insertion or deletion.<br><br>19. Such mutations that change reading frame are referred to as frameshift mutations.<br><br>20. Point mutations can be substitution, insertion or deletion of single base pair.<br><br>21.

The ribosome acts as a catalyst for the formation of peptide bond.<br><br>8. 23S rRNA in bacteria is the enzyme or ribozyme for the formation of peptide bond.<br><br>9. A translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA flanked by the start codon AUG and the stop codon.<br><br>10. The translational unit has the coding sequence in between start and stop codons.<br><br>11. mRNA has some additional sequences that are not translated and are referred to as untranslated regions or UTR.<br><br>12. UTRs are present at both 5' end before start codon and at 3' end after stop codon.<br><br>13. UTRs are required for efficient translation process.<br><br>14. For initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon AUG.<br><br>15. The start codon AUG is recognised only by the initiator tRNA.<br><br>16. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis after initiation.<br><br>17. During elongation, complexes composed of amino acid linked to tRNA sequentially bind to appropriate codon in mRNA.<br><br>18. Binding occurs by forming complementary base pairs with the tRNA anticodon.<br><br>19. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA during elongation.<br><br>20.

In absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is provided in the growth medium, the lactose is transported into the cells.<br><br>4. Lactose is transported into cells through the action of permease enzyme.<br><br>5. A very low level of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time, otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells.<br><br>6. The lactose then induces the operon.<br><br>7. The repressor of the operon is synthesised all-the-time constitutively from the i gene.<br><br>8. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon.<br><br>9. When repressor binds to operator, it prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon.<br><br>10. In the presence of an inducer such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is inactivated by interaction with the inducer.<br><br>11. Inactivation of repressor allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter.<br><br>12. When RNA polymerase gets access to promoter, transcription proceeds.<br><br>13. Regulation of lac operon can be visualised as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate.<br><br>14. Glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac operon.<br><br>15. Regulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative regulation.<br><br>16. Lac operon is under control of positive regulation as well.<br><br>17. In absence of inducer, repressor mRNA binds to the operator region and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon.<br><br>18. In presence of inducer, transcription of lac operon occurs producing lac mRNA.<br><br>19. Translation of lac mRNA produces beta-galactosidase, permease and transacetylase enzymes.<br><br>20.

With whole genome sequence and high-power technologies, researchers can study all genes in a genome, transcripts in particular tissue or organ, and how genes work together in interconnected networks.<br><br>2. 99.9 per cent of base sequence among humans is the same.<br><br>3. It is the differences in DNA sequence which make every individual unique in their phenotypic appearance.<br><br>4. If one aims to find genetic differences between individuals, sequencing DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive task.<br><br>5. DNA fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any two individuals.<br><br>6. DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific regions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA.<br><br>7. In repetitive DNA sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times.<br><br>8. Repetitive DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during density gradient centrifugation.<br><br>9. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and the other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA.<br><br>10. Satellite DNA is classified into many categories depending on base composition (A:T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number of repetitive units.<br><br>11. Examples of satellite DNA categories include micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc.<br><br>12. Satellite DNA sequences normally do not code for any proteins.<br><br>13. Satellite DNA sequences form a large portion of human genome.<br><br>14. Satellite DNA sequences show high degree of polymorphism.<br><br>15. Satellite DNA sequences form the basis of DNA fingerprinting.<br><br>16. DNA from every tissue (such as blood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc) from an individual shows the same degree of polymorphism.<br><br>17. DNA from various tissues becomes very useful identification tool in forensic applications.<br><br>18. Polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children.<br><br>19. DNA fingerprinting is the basis of paternity testing in case of disputes.<br><br>20. Polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping of human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting.<br><br>21. Polymorphism means variation at genetic level.<br><br>22. Polymorphism arises due to mutations.<br><br>23. New mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in the germ cells.<br><br>24. Germ cells are cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing organisms.<br><br>25.

Louis Pasteur showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast while in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from killed yeast.<br><br>19. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all but it did not answer how the first life form came on earth.<br><br>20. Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules like RNA and protein.<br><br>21.

When migration of a section of population to another place occurs, gene frequencies change in the original as well as in the new population.<br><br>11. New genes or alleles are added to the new population and these are lost from the old population during gene migration.<br><br>12. There would be a gene flow if gene migration happens multiple times.<br><br>13. If the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift.<br><br>14. Sometimes the change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population that they become a different species.<br><br>15.

Some land reptiles went back into water to evolve into fish like reptiles probably 200 mya (e.g. Ichthyosaurs).<br><br>3. The land reptiles were, of course, the dinosaurs.<br><br>4. The biggest dinosaur was Tyrannosaurus rex which was about 20 feet in height and had huge fearsome dagger like teeth.<br><br>5. About 65 mya, the dinosaurs suddenly disappeared from the earth.<br><br>6. The true reason for dinosaur extinction is not known.<br><br>7. Some say climatic changes killed the dinosaurs, some say most of them evolved into birds.<br><br>8. Small sized reptiles of the dinosaur era still exist today.<br><br>9. The first mammals were like shrews and their fossils are small sized.<br><br>10. Mammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the mother's body.<br><br>11. Mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding danger at least.<br><br>12. When reptiles came down, mammals took over this earth.<br><br>13. In South America there were mammals resembling horse, hippopotamus, bear, rabbit, etc.<br><br>14. Due to continental drift, when South America joined North America, these animals were overridden by North American fauna.<br><br>15. Due to the same continental drift, pouched mammals of Australia survived because of lack of competition from any other mammal.<br><br>16. Some mammals live wholly in water like whales, dolphins, seals and sea cows.<br><br>17. The most successful story is the evolution of man with language skills and self-consciousness.<br><br>18. About 15 mya, primates called Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus were existing.<br><br>19. Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.<br><br>20. Ramapithecus was more man-like while Dryopithecus was more ape-like.<br><br>21. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia and Tanzania.<br><br>22. These fossils revealed hominid features leading to the belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa.<br><br>23. The man-like primates were probably not taller than 4 feet but walked up right.<br><br>24. Australopithecines probably lived in East African grasslands about 2 mya.<br><br>25. Evidence shows Australopithecines hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate fruit.<br><br>26. The creature called the first human-like being the hominid was called Homo habilis.<br><br>27. Homo habilis had brain capacities between 650-800cc.<br><br>28. Homo habilis probably did not eat meat.<br><br>29. Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 revealed the next stage, i.e., Homo erectus about 1.5 mya.<br><br>30. Homo erectus had a large brain around 900cc."],

Mary Mallon nicknamed Typhoid Mary was a typhoid carrier who spread typhoid through the food she prepared.<br><br>3. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae bacteria are responsible for pneumonia in humans.<br><br>4. Pneumonia infects the alveoli or air filled sacs of the lungs.<br><br>5. In pneumonia, the alveoli get filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration.<br><br>6. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache.<br><br>7. In severe cases of pneumonia, lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour.<br><br>8. A healthy person acquires pneumonia by inhaling droplets or aerosols released by infected person.<br><br>9. Pneumonia can also spread by sharing glasses and utensils with an infected person.<br><br>10. Dysentery, plague and diphtheria are some other bacterial diseases in man.<br><br>11. Rhino viruses cause one of the most infectious human ailments - the common cold.<br><br>12. Rhino viruses infect the nose and respiratory passage but not the lungs.<br><br>13. Common cold is characterised by nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache and tiredness.<br><br>14. Common cold usually lasts for 3-7 days.<br><br>15. Droplets from cough or sneezes of infected person are inhaled directly or transmitted through contaminated objects.<br><br>16. Contaminated objects like pens, books, cups, doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse can cause infection in healthy person.<br><br>17. Some human diseases are caused by protozoans.<br><br>18. Malaria is a disease man has been fighting since many years.<br><br>19. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan, is responsible for malaria.<br><br>20. Different species of Plasmodium like P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum are responsible for different types of malaria.<br><br>21. Malignant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.<br><br>22. Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito.<br><br>23. Plasmodium parasites initially multiply within the liver cells.<br><br>24. After multiplying in liver, Plasmodium attacks the red blood cells resulting in their rupture.<br><br>25. The rupture of RBCs is associated with release of a toxic substance haemozoin.<br><br>26. Haemozoin is responsible for the chill and high fever recurring every three to four days in malaria.<br><br>27. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, parasites enter the mosquito body and undergo further development.<br><br>28. The parasites multiply within mosquito to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands.<br><br>29. When mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into human body thereby initiating infection.<br><br>30. The malarial parasite requires two hosts - human and mosquitoes - to complete its life cycle.<br><br>31. Humans are the intermediate hosts in malarial life cycle.<br><br>32. Mosquito is the vector or transmitting agent in malarial life cycle."],

Several microbes are useful in many ways and contribute to human welfare.<br><br>3. Microbes and products derived from them are used in everyday life.<br><br>4. Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it to curd.<br><br>5. During growth, LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest milk proteins.<br><br>6. A small amount of curd added to fresh milk as inoculum or starter contains millions of LAB.<br><br>7. At suitable temperatures, LAB multiply and convert milk to curd.<br><br>8. Conversion of milk to curd improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B12.<br><br>9. In the stomach, LAB play a beneficial role in checking disease-causing microbes.<br><br>10. Dough for making dosa and idli is fermented by bacteria.<br><br>11. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to production of CO2 gas by bacteria.<br><br>12. CO2 in dough is produced by metabolic pathways, not by simple chemical reactions.<br><br>13. Dough for making bread is fermented using baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br><br>14. Traditional drinks and foods are made by fermentation using microbes.<br><br>15. Toddy, a traditional drink of southern India, is made by fermenting sap from palms.<br><br>16. Microbes are used to ferment fish, soyabean and bamboo-shoots to make foods.<br><br>17. Cheese is one of the oldest food items in which microbes were used.<br><br>18. Different varieties of cheese are known by their characteristic texture, flavour and taste.<br><br>19. The specificity of cheese characteristics comes from the microbes used.<br><br>20. Large holes in Swiss cheese are due to production of large amount of CO2 by Propionibacterium sharmanii.<br><br>21. Roquefort cheese is ripened by growing specific fungi which give it a particular flavour.<br><br>22. Microbes are used in industry to synthesise products valuable to human beings.<br><br>23.

In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>13. Air is pumped into aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>14. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs.<br><br>15. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures.<br><br>16. Growing microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>17. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent.<br><br>18. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>19. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>20. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a water sample.<br><br>21. Indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.<br><br>22. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>23. Once BOD is reduced significantly, effluent is passed into a settling tank.<br><br>24. In settling tank, bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment.<br><br>25. This sediment is called activated sludge.<br><br>26. A small part of activated sludge is pumped back into aeration tank as inoculum.<br><br>27. The remaining major part of sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters.<br><br>28. In anaerobic sludge digesters, bacteria grow anaerobically.<br><br>29. These bacteria digest the bacteria and fungi in the sludge.<br><br>30. During digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>31. These gases form biogas which can be used as source of energy.<br><br>32. Biogas is inflammable and can be used as energy source.<br><br>33. The effluent from secondary treatment plant is generally released into natural water bodies like rivers and streams."],

DNA fragments separate according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel.<br><br>7. The smaller the DNA fragment size, the farther it moves in gel electrophoresis.<br><br>8. The separated DNA fragments can be visualised only after staining with ethidium bromide followed by exposure to UV radiation.<br><br>9. Pure DNA fragments cannot be seen in visible light without staining.<br><br>10. Bright orange coloured bands of DNA are seen in ethidium bromide stained gel exposed to UV light.<br><br>11. The separated bands of DNA are cut out from the agarose gel and extracted from the gel piece.<br><br>12. The process of cutting out and extracting DNA bands from agarose gel is known as elution.<br><br>13. DNA fragments purified by elution are used in constructing recombinant DNA by joining them with cloning vectors.<br><br>14. Plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate within bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA.<br><br>15. Bacteriophages have very high copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cell because of their high number per cell.<br><br>16. Some plasmids may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have 15-100 copies per cell.<br><br>17. The copy numbers of plasmids can go even higher than 100 copies per cell.<br><br>18. If we link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can multiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or bacteriophage.<br><br>19. Cloning vectors are engineered in such a way that they help easy linking of foreign DNA.<br><br>20. Cloning vectors help in selection of recombinants from non-recombinants."],

The enzyme DNA polymerase extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template.<br><br>3. If the process of DNA replication is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times.<br><br>4. Repeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase isolated from bacterium Thermus aquaticus.<br><br>5. Thermostable DNA polymerase remains active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA.<br><br>6. The amplified DNA fragment can be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning.<br><br>7.

If a recombinant DNA bearing gene for ampicillin resistance is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells.<br><br>9. If we spread transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow while untransformed recipient cells will die.<br><br>10. Due to ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the presence of ampicillin.<br><br>11.

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23. Hybrids produced by protoplast fusion are called somatic hybrids and the process is called somatic hybridisation.<br><br>24.

Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution to minimise fertiliser and chemical usage and their harmful environmental effects.<br><br>4. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) are plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation.<br><br>5. Genetic modification has made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salt and heat.<br><br>6. GM crops have reduced reliance on chemical pesticides through development of pest-resistant varieties.<br><br>7.

Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis and is used in pest resistant plant production.<br><br>12. Bt toxin gene has been cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis and expressed in cotton to create insect resistance without insecticides.<br><br>13. Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean are examples of pest-resistant GM crops.<br><br>14. Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill lepidopterans like tobacco budworm and armyworm.<br><br>15. Bacillus thuringiensis also kills coleopterans like beetles and dipterans like flies and mosquitoes.<br><br>16. Bacillus thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth.<br><br>17. The protein crystals of Bacillus thuringiensis contain a toxic insecticidal protein.<br><br>18. Bt toxin protein exists as inactive protoxins in the bacterium which do not harm Bacillus thuringiensis itself.<br><br>19. When an insect ingests the inactive Bt toxin, it is converted into active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut.<br><br>20. The alkaline pH of insect gut solubilises the Bt toxin protein crystals converting them to active form.<br><br>21. The activated Bt toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells of insects.<br><br>22. Activated Bt toxin creates pores in midgut epithelial cells that increase cell swelling and lysis.<br><br>23. The pores created by Bt toxin eventually cause death of the insect through cell lysis.<br><br>24.

Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode that infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield.<br><br>9. A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense.<br><br>11. RNA interference involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule.<br><br>12.

Transposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate.<br><br>15. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant for RNAi-based resistance.<br><br>16. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti sense RNA in the host cells.<br><br>17. The sense and antisense RNA are complementary to each other and form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA).<br><br>18.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. In mammals including humans, insulin is synthesised as a pro-hormone containing an extra stretch called the C peptide.<br><br>2. The C peptide is not present in mature insulin and is removed during maturation into functional insulin.<br><br>3. The main challenge for production of insulin using rDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a mature form.<br><br>4. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B chains of human insulin.<br><br>5. The DNA sequences for insulin chains were introduced into plasmids of E. coli to produce insulin chains.<br><br>6. Chains A and B of insulin were produced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulphide bonds to form human insulin.<br><br>7. Gene therapy is an attempt to provide corrective therapy for hereditary diseases.<br><br>8. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect diagnosed in a child or embryo.<br><br>9. In gene therapy, genes are inserted into a persons cells and tissues to treat a disease.<br><br>10. Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to compensate for the non-functional gene.<br><br>11. The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency.<br><br>12. Adenosine deaminase enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function properly.<br><br>13. ADA deficiency disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase.<br><br>14. In some children, ADA deficiency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation.<br><br>15. ADA deficiency can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection.<br><br>16. The problem with bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy is that they are not completely curative.<br><br>17. In gene therapy for ADA deficiency, lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside the body.<br><br>18. A functional ADA cDNA is introduced into lymphocytes using a retroviral vector.<br><br>19. Genetically engineered lymphocytes with functional ADA cDNA are subsequently returned to the patient.<br><br>20. As these genetically modified cells are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes.<br><br>21. If the gene isolated from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could lead to permanent cure.<br><br>22. For effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and understanding its pathophysiology is very important.<br><br>23. Molecular diagnosis enables early diagnosis and better understanding of disease pathophysiology using conventional methods.<br><br>24. The proinsulin needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature and functional hormone.<br><br>25. Gene therapy aims to take over the function of and compensate for the non-functional gene by introducing a normal gene."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Rice is an important food grain whose presence goes back thousands of years in Asias agricultural history.<br><br>2. There are an estimated 200,000 varieties of rice in India alone.<br><br>3. The diversity of rice in India is one of the richest in the world.<br><br>4. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique aroma and flavour.<br><br>5. 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown in India.<br><br>6. There is a reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and poetry as it has been grown for centuries.<br><br>7. In 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Office.<br><br>8. The new variety of Basmati has been developed from old Indian farmers varieties.<br><br>9. Indian Basmati was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty.<br><br>10. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted in the US market.<br><br>11. Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines like turmeric and neem.<br><br>12. If patent applications are not countered immediately, other countries or individuals may encash on our rich legacy.<br><br>13. Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies without proper authorisation and without compensatory payment.<br><br>14. Most industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in biodiversity and traditional knowledge.<br><br>15. The developing and underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional knowledge related to bio-resources.<br><br>16. Traditional knowledge related to bio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications.<br><br>17. Traditional knowledge can also be used to save time, effort and expenditure during commercialisation of bio-resources.<br><br>18. There has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate compensation, and benefit sharing between developed and developing countries.<br><br>19. Some nations are developing laws to prevent unauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional knowledge.<br><br>20. The Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment of the Indian Patents Bill.<br><br>21. The second amendment of Indian Patents Bill takes issues like patent terms, emergency provisions, research and development initiatives into consideration.<br><br>22. Biopiracy involves use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organisations without proper authorisation from countries and people concerned.<br><br>23. The patent on Basmati rice was an example of biopiracy as it was developed from Indian farmers varieties without proper compensation.<br><br>24. Vigilance is required to immediately counter patent applications that may exploit our traditional knowledge and bio-resources.<br><br>25. Laws are being developed globally to ensure fair compensation and benefit sharing for use of bio-resources and traditional knowledge."],
